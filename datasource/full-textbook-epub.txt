	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_2">INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p class="block_">Human beings are so curious about things around them. Things around us are related to one another. Some bodies are at rest and some are in motion. Rest and motion are interrelated terms.</p>
	<p class="block_">In the previous classes you have learnt about various types of motion such as linear motion, circular motion, oscillatory motion, and so on. So far, you have discussed the motion of bodies in terms of their displacement, velocity, and acceleration. In this unit, let us investigate the cause of motion.</p>
	<p class="block_">When a body is at rest, starts moving, a question that arises in our mind is ‘what causes the body to move?’ Similarly, when a moving object comes to rest, you would like to know what brings it to rest? If a moving object speeds up or slows down or changes its direction. what speeds up or slows down the body? What changes the direction of motion?</p>
	<p class="block_">One answer for all the above questions is ‘Force’. In a common man’s understanding of motion, a body needs a ‘push’ or ‘pull’ to move or bring to rest or change its velocity. Hence, this ‘push’ or ‘pull’ is called as ‘force’.</p>
	<p class="block_">Let us define force in a more scientific manner using the three laws proposed by Sir Isaac Newton. These laws help you to understand the motion of a body and also to predict the future course of its motion, if you know the forces acting on it. Before Newton formulated his three laws of motion, a different perception about the force and motion of bodies prevailed. Let us first look at these ideas and then eventually learn about Newton’s laws in this unit.</p>
	<p class="block_">Mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the effect of force on bodies. It is divided into two branches, namely, statics and dynamics.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Statics:</b> It deals with the bodies, which are at rest under the action of forces.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Dynamics:</b> It is the study of moving bodies under the action of forces. Dynamics is further divided as follows.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Kinematics:</b> It deals with the motion of bodies without considering the cause of motion.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Kinetics:</b> It deals with the motion of bodies considering the cause of motion.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_3">1.1 FORCE AND MOTION</h2>
	<p class="block_">According to Aristotle a Greek Philosopher and Scientist, the natural state of earthly bodies is ‘rest’. He stated that a moving body naturally comes to rest without any external influence of the force. Such motions are termed as ‘natural motion’ (Force independent). He also proposed that a force (a push or a pull) is needed to make the bodies to move from their natural state (rest) and behave contrary to their own natural state called as ‘violent motion’ (Force dependent). Further, he said, when two different mass bodies are dropped from a height, the heavier body falls faster than the lighter one.</p>
	<p class="block_">Galileo proposed the following concepts about force, motion and inertia of bodies:</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_6">The natural state of all earthly bodies is either the state of rest or the state of uniform motion.</li>
	<li class="block_7">A body in motion will continue to be in the same state of motion as long as no external force is applied.</li>
	<li class="block_7">When a force is applied on bodies, they resist any change in their state. This property of bodies is called ‘inertia’.</li>
	<li class="block_8">When dropped from a height in vacuum, bodies of different size, shape and mass fall at the same rate and reach the ground at the same time.</li>
</ol>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_4">1.2 INERTIA</h2>
	<p class="block_9">While you are travelling in a bus or in a car, when a sudden brake is applied, the upper part of your body leans in the forward direction. Similarly, when the vehicle suddenly is moved forward from rest, you lean backward. This is due to, anybody would like to continue to be in its state of rest or the state of motion. This is known as ‘inertia’.</p>
	<p class="block_9">The inherent property of a body to resist any change in its state of rest or the state of uniform motion, unless it is influenced upon by an external unbalanced force, is known as ‘inertia’.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Activity 1</p>
	<p class="block_">Take a glass tumbler and place a small cardboard on it as shown in the figure. Now, keep a coin at the center of the  cardboard. Then, flick the cardboard quickly. What do you observe?</p>
	<p class="block_">The cardboard falls off the ground and the coin falls into the glass tumbler.</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-6.png" alt=" This is a picture. It explain about a inertia due to rest ia given. In this picture a glass tumbler, card board and a coin" class="calibre8"/></p>
	<p class="block_">In activity described above, the inertia of the coin keeps it in the state of rest when the cardboard moves. Then, when the cardboard has moved, the coin falls into the tumbler due to gravity. This happens due to ‘inertia of rest’.</p>
	<h3 class="block_11" id="toc_id_5">1.2.1 Types of Inertia</h3>
	<p class="block_12"><img src="images/image-7.png" alt="Here is a QR code with a number of XF6DH" class="calibre9"/></p>
	<div class="calibre10">
	<div class="block_13">a) Inertia of rest: The resistance of a body to change its state of rest is called inertia of rest.</div>
	<div class="block_13">b) Inertia of motion: The resistance of a body to change its state of motion is called inertia of motion.</div>
	<div class="block_14">c) Inertia of direction: The resistance of a body to change its direction of motion is called inertia of direction.</div>
</div>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_6">1.2.2 Examples of Inertia</h3>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_6">An athlete runs some distance before jumping. Because, this will help him jump longer and higher. (Inertia of motion)</li>
	<li class="block_7">When you make a sharp turn while driving a car, you tend to lean sideways, (Inertia of direction).</li>
	<li class="block_8"> When you vigorously shake the branches of a tree, some of the leaves and fruits are detached and they fall down, (Inertia of rest).</li>
</ol>

	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image162.png" alt="Tis is a picture. It explains inertia due to motion. In this picture, a girl with scatting is moving continuously is given." class="calibre11"/></p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_7">1.3 LINEAR MOMENTUM</h3>
	<p class="block_">The impact of a force is more if the velocity and the mass of the body is more. To quantify the impact of a force exactly, a new physical quantity known as linear momentum is defined. The linear momentum measures the impact of a force on a body.</p>
	<p class="block_">The product of mass and velocity of a moving body gives the magnitude of linear momentum. It acts in the direction of the velocity of the object. Linear momentum is a vector quantity.</p>
	<p class="block_">Linear Momentum = mass × velocity</p>
	<p class="block_">p = m v<span class="tab">      </span> (1.1)</p>
	<p class="block_9">It helps to measure the magnitude of a force. Unit of momentum in SI system is kilogram metre second power minus one and in C.G.S system its unit is gram centimeter second power minus one.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_8">1.4 NEWTON’S LAWS OF MOTION</h2>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_9">1.4.1 Newton’s First Law</h3>
	<p class="block_9">This law states that everybody continues to be in its state of rest or the state of uniform motion along a straight line unless it is acted upon by some external force. It gives the definition of force as well as inertia. body.</p>
	<p class="block_">Force has both magnitude and direction. So, it is a vector quantity.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_10">1.4.3 Types of forces</h3>
	<p class="block_">Based on the direction in which the forces act, they can be classified into two types as:</p>
	<div class="calibre10">
	<div class="block_13">a) Like parallel forces and </div>
	<div class="block_14">b) Unlike parallel forces.</div>
</div>
	<p class="block_">(a) Like parallel forces: Two or more forces of equal or unequal magnitude acting along the same direction, parallel to each other are called like parallel forces.</p>
	<p class="block_">(b) Unlike parallel forces: If two or more equal forces or unequal forces act along opposite directions parallel to each other, then they are called unlike parallel forces. Action of forces are given in Table 1.1.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_11">1.4.4 Resultant Force</h3>
	<p class="block_">When several forces act simultaneously on the same body, then the combined effect of the multiple forces can be represented by a single force, which is termed as ‘resultant force’. It is equal to the vector sum (adding the magnitude of the forces with their direction) of all the forces.</p>

	<p class="block_">If the resultant force of all the forces acting on a body is equal to zero, then the body will be in equilibrium. Such forces are called balanced forces. If the resultant force is not equal to zero, then it causes the motion of the body due to unbalanced forces</p>
	<p class="block_">Examples: Drawing water from a well, force applied with a crowbar, forces on a weight balance, etcetera.</p>
	<p class="block_">A system can be brought to equilibrium by applying another force, which is equal to the resultant force in magnitude, but opposite in direction. Such force is called as ‘Equilibrant’.</p>

	<p class="block_9">Have you observed the position of the handle in a door? It is always placed at the edge of door and not at some other place. Why? Have you tried to push a door by placing your hand closer to the hinges or the fixed edge? What do you observe?</p>
	<p class="block_9">The door can be easily opened or closed when you apply the force at a point far away from the fixed edge. In this case, the effect of the force you apply is to turn the door about the fixed edge. This turning effect of the applied force is more when the distance between the fixed edge and the point of application of force is more.</p>

	<p class="block_">The axis of the fixed edge about which the door is rotated is called as the ‘axis of rotation’. Fix one end of a rod to the floor/wall and apply a force at the other end tangentially. The rod will be turned about the fixed point is called as ‘point of rotation’.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_13">1.4.6 Moment of the Force</h3>
	<p class="block_">The rotating or turning effect of a force about a fixed point or fixed axis is called moment of the force about that point or torque(τ). It is measured by the product of the force (F) and the perpendicular distance (d) between the fixed point or the fixed axis and the line of action of the force.</p>
	<p class="block_">τ = F × d (1.2)</p>
	<p class="block_">Torque is a vector quantity. It is acting along the direction, perpendicular to the plane containing the line of action of force and the distance. Its SI unit is Newton metre.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Couple:</b> Two equal and unlike parallel forces applied simultaneously at two distinct points constitute a couple. The line of action of the two forces does not coincide. It does not produce any translatory motion since the resultant is zero. But a couple results in causes the rotation of the body. Rotating effect of a couple is known as moment of a couple.</p>
	<p class="block_">Examples: Turning a tap, winding or unwinding a screw, spinning of a top, etcetera.</p>
	<p class="block_">Moment of a couple is measured by the product of any one of the forces and the perpendicular distance between the line of action of two forces. The turning effect of a couple is measured by the magnitude of its moment.</p>
	<p class="block_">Moment of a couple = Force × perpendicular distance between the line of action of forces</p>
	<p class="block_">M = F × S (1.3)</p>
	<p class="block_9">The unit of moment of a couple is newton metre (N m) in SI system and dyne centi metre in CGS system.</p>
	<p class="block_9">By convention, the direction of moment of a force or couple is taken as positive if the body is rotated in the anti-clockwise direction and negative if it is rotate in the clockwise direction. They are shown in </p>

When the heavier person comes closer to the pivot point (fulcrum) the distance of the line of action of the force decreases. It causes less amount of torque to act on it. This enables the lighter person to lift the heavier person.</p>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_15">1.4.8 Principle of Moments</h3>
	<p class="block_9">When a number of like or unlike parallel forces act on a rigid body and the body is in equilibrium, then the algebraic sum of the moments in the clockwise direction is equal to the algebraic sum of the moments in the anticlockwise direction. In other words, at equilibrium, the algebraic sum of the moments of all the individual forces about any point is equal to zero.</p>
	<p class="block_23"><img src="images/image-15.png" alt="This is a picture. In this picture principle of moment is explained . " class="calibre24"/></p>
	<p class="block_">In the illustration given in figure 1.5, the force F one produces an anticlockwise rotation at a distance d one from the point of pivot P (called fulcrum) and the force F two<sub class="calibre25"> </sub>produces a clockwise rotation at a distance d two from the point of pivot P. The principle of moments can be written as follows:</p>

	<p class="block_9">According to this law, “the force acting on a body is directly proportional to the rate of change of linear momentum of the body and the change in momentum takes place in the direction of the force”.</p>
	<p class="block_9">This law helps us to measure the amount of force. So, it is also called as ‘law of force’. Let, ‘m’ be the mass of a moving body, moving along a straight line with an initial speed ‘u’ After a time interval of ‘t’, the velocity of the body changes to ‘v’ due to the impact of an unbalanced external force F.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Initial momentum of the body P initial = m u </p>
	<p class="block_9">Final momentum of the body P final = m v </p>
	<p class="block_9">Change in momentum Δp = P final minus P initial </p>
	<p class="block_9">= m v minus m u</p>

	<p class="block_26"><b class="calibre6">F= m times a </b>(1.6)</p>
	<p class="block_">Force = mass × acceleration</p>
	<p class="block_9">No external force is required to maintain the motion of a body moving with uniform velocity. When the net force acting on a body is not equal to zero, then definitely the velocity of the body will change. Thus, change in momentum takes place in the direction of the force. The change may take place either in magnitude or in direction or in both.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Force is required to produce the acceleration of a body. In a uniform circular motion, even though the speed (magnitude of velocity) remains constant, the direction of the velocity changes at every point on the circular path. So, the acceleration is produced along the radius called as centripetal acceleration. The force, which produces this acceleration is called as centripetal force, about which you have learnt in class IX.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Units of force: SI unit of force is newton (N) and in C.G.S system its unit is dyne.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Definition of 1 newton (N): The amount of force required for a body of mass 1 kiloram produces an acceleration of 1 metre second power minus two, 1 N = 1 kilogram metre second power minus two</p>

	<p class="block_">A large force acting for a very short interval of time is called as ‘Impulsive force’. When a force F acts on a body for a period of time t, then the product of force and time is known as ‘impulse’ represented by ‘J’</p>

	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-16.png" alt="A QR Code for here with code of IJ9CQ" class="calibre30"/></p>
	<p class="block_">There is no change in the linear momentum of a system of bodies as long as no net external force acts on them. </p>
	<p class="block_">Let us prove the law of conservation of linear momentum with the following illustration:</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-17.png" alt="This is a picture. In this picture  conservation of liner momentum is explained." class="calibre31"/></p>
	<p class="block_12">Proof:</p>
	<p class="block_">Let two bodies A and B having masses m 1 and m 2 move with initial velocity u 1 and u 2 in a straight line. Let the velocity of the first body be higher than that of the second body that is . During an interval of time t second, they tend to have a collision. After the impact, both of them move along the same straight line with a velocity v 1 and v 2 respectively.</p>
	<p class="block_28">Force on body B due to A,  F A = m2 times (v 2 minus u 2) divided by t</p>
	<p class="block_29">Force on body A due to B, F B = m 1 times (v 1 minus u 1) divided by t</p>
	<p class="block_30">By Newton’s III law of motion, </p>
	<p class="block_30">Action force = Reaction force </p>
	<p class="block_30">F A<sub class="calibre25"> </sub>= minus F B</p>
	<p class="block_30">m 1 times (v 1 minus u 1) divided by t = minus m2 times (v 2 minus u 2) divided by t</p>
	<p class="block_">m 1 v 1 + m 2 v 2 = m 1 u 1 + m 2 u 2<span class="text_1"><span class="tab">      </span></span><span class="text_1"> equation </span>(1.9)</p>
	<p class="block_">The above equation confirms in the absence of an external force, the algebraic sum of the momentum after collision is numerically equal to the algebraic sum of the momentum before collision.</p>
	<p class="block_">Hence the law of conservation linear momentum is proved.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_20">1.9 ROCKET PROPULSION</h2>
	<p class="block_">Propulsion of rockets is based on the law of conservation of linear momentum as well as Newton’s III law of motion. Rockets are filled with a fuel (either liquid or solid) in the propellant tank. When the rocket is fired, this fuel is burnt and a hot gas is ejected with a high speed from the nozzle of the rocket, producing a huge momentum. To balance this momentum, an equal and opposite reaction force is produced in the combustion chamber, which makes the rocket project forward.</p>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">While in motion, the mass of the rocket gradually decreases, until the fuel is completely burnt out. Since, there is no net external force acting on it, the linear momentum of the system is conserved. The mass of the rocket decreases with altitude, which results in the gradual increase in velocity of the rocket.  At one stage, it reaches a velocity, which is sufficient to just escape from the gravitational pull of the Earth. This velocity is called escape velocity.

	<p class="block_">The velocity of the object keeps changing as it falls down. This change in velocity must be due to the force acting on the object. The acceleration of the body is due to the Earth’s gravitational force. So, it is called as ‘acceleration due to the gravitational force of the Earth’ or ‘acceleration due to gravity of the Earth’. It is represented as ‘g’. Its unit is m s power minus 2.</p>
	<p class="block_">Mean value of the acceleration due to gravity is taken as 9.8 m s power minus 2 on the surface of the Earth. This means that the velocity of a body during the downward free fall motion varies by </p>

	<p class="block_">It’s amazing. You actually feel as if you are falling freely without having any weight. This is due to the phenomenon of ‘weightlessness’. You seem to have lost your weight when you move down with a certain acceleration. Sometimes, you experience the same feeling while travelling in a lift.</p>
	<p class="block_">When the person in a lift moves down with an acceleration (a) equal to the acceleration due to gravity (g), that is , when a = g, this motion is called as ‘free fall’. Here, the apparent weight</p>
	<p class="block_"> (R = m (g – g) = 0) bracket R equal to m bracket g minus g dash  of the person is zero. This condition or state refers to the state of weightlessness. (Refer case 4 from Table 1.2).</p>
	<p class="block_">The same effect takes place while falling freely in a roller coaster or on a swing or in a vertical giant wheel. You feel an apparent weight loss and weight gain when you are moving up and down in such rides.</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_35">INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p class="block_">Light is a form of energy which travels in the form of waves. The path of light is called ray of light and group of these rays are called as beam of light. Any object which gives out light are termed as source of light. Some of the sources emit their own light and they are called as luminous objects. All the stars, including the Sun, are examples for luminous objects. We all know that we are able to see objects with the help of our eyes. But<span class="calibre28"> we cannot see any object in a dark room. Can you explain why?  If your answer is ‘we need light to see objects’, the next question is ‘if you make the light from a torch to fall on your eyes, will you be able to see the objects?’ Definitely, ‘NO’. We can see the objects only when the light is made to fall on the objects and the light reflected from the objects is viewed by our eyes. You would have studied about the reflection and refraction of light elaborately in your previous classes. In this chapter, we shall discuss about the scattering of light, images formed by convex and concave lenses, human eye and optical instruments such as telescopes and microscopes.</span></p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_36">2.1 PROPERTIES OF LIGHT<span class="tab">      </span></h2>
	<p class="block_9">Let us recall the properties of light and the important aspects on refraction of light.</p>
	<p class="block_9">1. Light is a form of energy.</p>
	<p class="block_9">2. Light always travels along a straight line.</p>
	<p class="block_9">3. Light does not need any medium for its propagation. It can even travel through vacuum.</p>
	<p class="block_9">4. The speed of light in vacuum or air is, c = 3 × 10 power 8metre second power –1.</p>
	<p class="block_9"><span class="calibre15">5. Since, light is in the form of waves, it is characterized by a wavelength (λ) and   a frequency (ν), which are related by the following equation: c = </span>nu into lambda<span class="calibre15">  (c - velocity of light).</span></p>
	<p class="block_9">6. Different coloured light has different wavelength and frequency.</p>
	<p class="block_9">7. Among the visible light, violet light has the lowest wavelength and red light has the highest wavelength.</p>
	<p class="block_9">8. When light is incident on the interface between two media, it is partly reflected and partly refracted.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_37">2.2 REFRACTION OF LIGHT</h2>
	<p class="block_9">When a ray of light travels from one transparent medium into another obliquely, the path of the light undergoes deviation. This deviation of ray of light is called refraction. Refraction takes place due to the difference in the velocity of light in different media. The velocity of light is more in a rarer medium and less in a denser medium. Refraction of light obeys two laws of refraction.</p>
	<p class="block_12">2.2.1 First law of refraction:</p>
	<p class="block_">The incident ray, the refracted ray of light and the normal to the refracting surface all lie in the same plane.</p>
	<p class="block_12">2.2.2 Second law of refraction:</p>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence and sine of the angle of refraction   is equal to the ratio of refractive indices of the two media. This law is also known as Snell’s law.</span></p>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28"> sin i divided by sin r equal to mew2 divided by mew 1  2.1</span></p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_67">Refractive index gives us an idea of how fast or how slow light travels in a medium. The ratio of speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in a medium is defined as refractive index mew of that medium.</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_68">Mew  = c by v</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li value="2" class="block_69">The speed of light in a medium is low if the refractive index of the medium is high and vice versa.</li>
	<li class="block_69"> When light travels from a denser medium into a rarer medium, the refracted ray is bent away from the normal drawn to the interface.</li>
	<li class="block_70"><span class="calibre28"> When light travels from a rarer medium into a denser medium, the refracted ray    is bent towards the normal drawn to the interface.</span></li>
</ol>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_38">2.3 REFRACTION OF A COMPOSITE LIGHT- DISPERSION OF LIGHT</h2>
	<p class="block_">We know that Sun is the fundamental and natural source of light. If a source of light produces a light of single colour, it is known as a monochromatic source. On the other hand, a composite source of light produces a white light which contains light of different colours. Sun light is a composite light which consists of light of various colours or wavelengths. Another example for a composite source is a mercury vapour lamp. What do you observe when a white light is refracted through a glass prism?</p>
	<p class="block_">When a beam of white light or composite light is refracted through any transparent media such as glass or water, it is split into its component colours. This phenomenon is called as ‘dispersion of light’.</p>
	<p class="block_">The band of colours is termed as spectrum. This spectrum consists of following colours: Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red. These colours are represented by the acronym “VIBGYOR”. Why do we get the spectrum when white light is refracted by a transparent medium? This is because, different coloured lights are bent through different angles. That is the angle of refraction is different for different colours.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Angle of refraction is the smallest for red and the highest for violet. From Snell’s law, we know that the angle of refraction is determined in terms of the refractive index of the medium. Hence, the refractive index of the medium is different for different coloured lights. This indicates that the refractive index of a medium is dependent on the wavelength of the light.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_39">2.4 SCATTERING OF LIGHT</h2>
	<p class="block_9"><span class="calibre15">When sunlight enters the Earth’s atmosphere, the atoms and molecules of different gases present in the atmosphere refract the light in all possible directions.  This is called as ‘Scattering of light’. In this phenomenon, the beam of light is redirected in all directions when it interacts with a particle of medium. The interacting particle of the medium is called as ‘scatterer’.</span><img src="images/image327.jpeg" alt="This is a picture. Scattering of light - Explained.

	<h3 class="block_11" id="toc_id_40">2.4.1 Types of scattering</h3>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">When a beam of light, interacts with   a constituent particle of the medium, it undergoes many kinds of scattering.  Based on initial and final energy of the light beam, scattering can be classified as,</span></p>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">1)  Elastic scattering   2) Inelastic scattering</span></p>
	<p class="block_12">1) Elastic scattering</p>
	<p class="block_">If the energy of the incident beam of light and the scattered beam of light are same, then it is called as ‘elastic scattering’.</p>
	<p class="block_">2) Inelastic<span class="calibre28">  </span> scattering</p>
	<p class="block_">If the energy of the incident beam of light and the scattered beam of light are not same, then it is called as ‘inelastic scattering’. The nature and size of the scatterer results in different types of scattering. They are</p>

	<p class="block_19">Rayleigh scattering</p>
	<p class="block_9"><span class="calibre15">The scattering of sunlight by the atoms   or molecules of the gases in the earth’s atmosphere is known as Rayleigh scattering.</span></p>
	<p class="block_19">Rayleigh’s scattering law</p>
	<p class="block_9"><span class="calibre15">Rayleigh’s scattering law states that, “The amount of scattering of light is inversely proportional to the fourth power of its wavelength”. Amount of scattering ‘S’  </span>proportional  1 by lambta power 4 According to this law, the shorter wavelength colours are scattered much more than the longer wavelength colours.</p>
	<p class="block_9">When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the blue colour (shorter wavelength) is scattered to a greater extent than the red colour (longer wavelength). This scattering causes the sky to appear in blue colour.</p>
	<p class="block_9">At sunrise and sunset, the light rays from the Sun have to travel a larger distance in the atmosphere than at noon. Hence, most of the blue lights are scattered away and only the red light which gets least scattered reaches us. Therefore, the colour of the Sun is red at sunrise and sunset.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Mie scattering</p>
	<p class="block_9">Mie scattering takes place when the diameter of the scatterer is similar to or larger than the wavelength of the incident light. It is also an elastic scattering. The amount of scattering is independent of wavelength.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Mie scattering is caused by pollen, dust, smoke, water droplets, and other particles in the lower portion of the atmosphere.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Mie scattering is responsible for the white appearance of the clouds. When white light falls on the water drop, all the colours are equally scattered which together form the white light.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Tyndall Scattering</p>
	<p class="block_">When a beam of sunlight, enters into a dusty room through a window, then its path becomes visible to us. This is because, the tiny dust particles present in the air of the room scatter the beam of light. This is an example of Tyndall Scattering.</p>
	<p class="block_">The scattering of light rays by the colloidal particles in the colloidal solution is called Tyndall Scattering or Tyndall Effect.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Do you Know</p>
	<p class="block_9">Colloid is a microscopically small substance that is equally dispersed throughout another material. Example: Milk, Ice cream, muddy water, smoke</p>
	<p class="block_12">Raman scattering</p>
	<p class="block_">When a parallel beam of monochromatic (single coloured) light passes through a gas or liquid or transparent solid, a part of light rays is scattered.</p>
	<p class="block_">The scattered light contains some additional frequencies (or wavelengths) other than that of incident frequency (or wavelength). This is known as Raman scattering or Raman Effect.</p>
	<p class="block_">Raman Scattering is defined as “The interaction of light ray with the particles of pure liquids or transparent solids, which leads to a change in wavelength or frequency.”</p>
	<p class="block_">The spectral lines having frequency equal to the incident ray frequency is called ‘Rayleigh line’ and the spectral lines which are having frequencies other than the incident ray frequency are called ‘Raman lines. The lines having frequencies lower than the incident frequency is called stokes lines and the lines having frequencies higher than the incident frequency are called Anti-stokes lines.</p>

	<p class="block_9">2. They are used in wide angle spy hole in doors.</p>
	<p class="block_9">3. They are used to correct the defect of vision called‘myopia’</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_48">2.11 LENS FORMULA</h2>
	<p class="block_">Like spherical mirrors, we have lens formula for spherical lenses. The lens formula gives the relationship among distance of the object (u), distance of the image (v) and the focal length (f) of the lens. It is expressed as 1 one by f equal to 1 by v minus 1 by u equation 2.2</p>
	<p class="block_">It is applicable to both convex and concave lenses. We need to give an at most care while solving numerical problems related to lenses in taking proper signs of different quantities.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_49">2.12 SIGN CONVENTION</h2>
	<p class="block_">Cartesian sign conventions are used for measuring the various distances in the ray diagrams of spherical lenses. According to cartesian sign convention,</p>
	<p class="block_">1. The object is always placed on the left side of the lens.</p>
	<p class="block_">2. All the distances are measured from the optical centre of the lens.</p>
	<p class="block_">3. The distances measured in the same direction as that of incident light are taken as positive.</p>
	<p class="block_">4. The distances measured against the direction of incident light are taken as negative.</p>
	<p class="block_">5. The distances measured upward and perpendicular to the principal axis is taken as positive.</p>
	<p class="block_">6. The distances measured downward and perpendicular to the principal axis is taken as negative.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_50">2.13 MAGNIFICATION OF A LENS</h2>
	<p class="block_">Like spherical mirrors, we have magnification for spherical lenses. Spherical lenses produce magnification and it is defined as the ratio of the height of the image to the height of an object. Magnification is denoted by the letter ‘m’. If height of the object is h and height of the image is h´, the magnification produced by lens is m = height of the image divided by height of the object =  h dash by h equation 2.3</p>
	<p class="block_">Also, it is related to the distance of the object (u) and the distance of the image (v) as follows:</p>
	<p class="block_">M = distance of the image divided by distance of the object = v by u equation 2.4</p>
	<p class="block_">If the magnification is greater than 1, then we get an enlarged image. On the other hand, if the magnification is less than 1, then we get a diminished image.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_51">2.14 LENS MAKER’S FORMULA</h2>
	<p class="block_61">All lenses are made up of transparent materials. Any optically transparent material will have a refractive index. The lens formula relates the focal length of a lens with the distance of object and image. For a maker of any lens, knowledge of radii of curvature of the lens is required. This clearly indicates the need for an equation relating the radii of curvature of the lens, the refractive index of the given material of the<span class="calibre28"> lens and the required focal length of the lens. The lens maker’s formula is one such equation. It is given as  </span> one by f equal to mew minus one into one by R1 minus one by R2 equation 2.5</p>
	<p class="block_">where mew is the refractive index of the material of the lens; R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the two faces of the lens; f is the focal length of the lens.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_52">2.15 POWER OF A LENS</h2>
	<p class="block_">When a ray of light falls on a lens, the ability to converge or diverge these light rays depends on the focal length of the lens. This ability of a lens to converge (convex lens) or diverge (concave lens) is called as its power. Hence, the power of a lens can be defined as the degree of convergence or divergence of light rays. Power of a lens is numerically defined as the reciprocal of its focal length.</p>
	<p class="block_61">p equal to one by f equation 2.6</p>
	<p class="block_">The SI unit of power of a lens is dioptre. It is represented by the symbol D. If focal length is expressed in ‘m’, then the power of lens is expressed in ‘D’ Thus 1D is the power of a lens, whose focal length is 1metre. 1D = 1metre<b class="calibre6"> </b>power minus1.</p>
	<p class="block_">By convention, the power of a convex lens is taken as positive whereas the power of a concave lens is taken, as negative.</p>
	<p class="block_12">More to Know</p>
	<p class="block_">The lens formula and lens maker’s formula are applicable to only thin lenses. In the case of thick lenses, these formulae with little modifications are used.</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_53">2.16 HUMAN EYE </h2>
	<p class="block_">The human eyes are most valuable and sensitive organs responsible for vision. They are the gateway to the wonderful world.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Structure of the eye</p>
	<p class="block_">The eye ball is approximately spherical in shape with a diameter of about 2.3 cm. It consists of a tough membrane called sclera, which protects the internal parts of the eye. Important parts of human eye are</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Cornea:</b> This is the thin and transparent layer on the front surface of the eyeball as shown in figure 2.15. It is the main refracting surface. When light enters through the cornea, it refracts or bends the light on to the lens.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Iris:</b> It is the coloured part of the eye. It may be blue, brown or green in colour. Every person has a unique colour, pattern and texture. Iris controls amount of light entering into the pupil like camera aperture.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Pupil:</b> It is the centre part of the Iris. It is the pathway for the light to retina.</p>
	<p class="block_">Retina: This is the back surface of the eye. It is the most sensitive part of human eye, on which real and inverted image of objects is formed.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Eye Lens –</b> It is the important part of human eye. It is convex in nature.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Ciliary muscles –</b> Eye lens is fixed between the ciliary muscles. It helps to change the focal length of the eye lens according to the position of the object. </p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-34.png" alt="This is a diagram which explains about the human eye with its parts is given." class="calibre62"/></p>
	<p class="block_12">Working of the eye</p>
	<p class="block_">The transparent layer cornea bends the light rays through pupil located at the centre part of the Iris. The adjusted light passes through the eye lens. Eye lens is convex in nature. So, the light rays from the objects are converged and a real and inverted image is formed on retina. Then, retina passes the received real and inverted image to the brain through optical nerves. Finally, the brain senses it as erects image.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Power of Accommodation</p>
	<p class="block_">The ability of the eye lens to focus nearby as well as the distant objects is called power of accommodation of the eye. This is achieved by changing the focal length of the eye lens with the help of ciliary muscles. Eye lens is made of a flexible, jelly-like material. By relaxing and contracting the ciliary muscle, the curvature and hence the call length of the eye lens can be altered. When we see distant objects, the ciliary muscle relaxes and makes the eye lens thinner. This increases the focal length of the eye lens. Hence, the distant object can be clearly seen. On the other hand, when we look at a closer object, the focal length of the eye lens is decreased by the contraction of ciliary muscle. Thus, the image of the closer object is clearly formed on the retina.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Persistence of vision</p>
	<p class="block_9">If the time interval between two consecutive light pulses is less than 1 by 16 second, human eye cannot distinguish them separately. It is called persistence of vision.</p>
	<p class="block_12">The far point and near point of the human eye</p>
	<p class="block_">The minimum distance required to see the objects distinctly without strain is called least distance of distinct vision. It is called as near point of eye. It is 25 cm for normal human eye.</p>
	<p class="block_">The maximum distance up to which the eye can see objects clearly is called as far point of the eye. It is infinity for normal eye.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_54">2.17 DEFECTS IN EYE</h2>
	<p class="block_">A normal human eye can clearly see all the objects placed between 25cm and infinity. But, for some people, the eye loses its power of accommodation. This could happen due to many reasons including ageing. Hence, their vision becomes defective. Let us discuss some of the common defects of human eye.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Myopia</p>
	<p class="block_">Myopia, also known as short sightedness, occurs due to the lengthening of eye ball. With this defect, nearby objects can be seen clearly but distant objects cannot be seen clearly. The focal length of eye lens is reduced or the distance between eye lens and retina increases. Hence, the far point will not be infinity for such eyes and the far point has come closer. Due to this, the image of distant objects is formed before the retina (Figure 2.16-a). This defect can be corrected using a concave lens (Figure 2.16-b). The focal length of the concave lens to be used is computed as follows:</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-35.png" alt="There are two diagrams given. they are a) vision with myopia  b) corrected  vision using a concave lens" class="calibre63"/></p>
	<p class="block_61">Let a person with myopia eye can see up to a distance x. Suppose that he wants to see all objects farther than this distance, that is up to infinity. Then the focal length of the required concave lens is</p>
	<p class="block_61"> f = minus x. If the person can see up to a distance x and he wishes to see up to a distance y, then, the focal length of the required concave lens is, <i class="calibre33"> x times y by x minus y equation 2.7</i></p>
	<p class="block_12">Hypermetropia</p>
	<p class="block_">Hypermetropia, also known as long sightedness, occurs due to the shortening of eye ball. With this defect, distant objects can be seen clearly but nearby objects cannot be seen clearly. The focal length of eye lens is increased or the distance between eye lens and retina decreases. Hence, the near point will not be at 25cm for such eyes and the near point has moved farther. Due to this, the image of nearby objects is formed behind the retina (Figure 2.17-a). This defect can be corrected using a convex lens (Figure 2.17-b). The focal length of the convex lens to be used is computed as follows:</p>
	<p class="block_74"><img src="images/image-36.png" alt="A figure is given which explains a vision with hypermetropia  b) corrected  vision using a concave lens " class="calibre64"/></p>
	<p class="block_61">Let a person with hypermetropia eye can see object beyond a distance d. Suppose that he wants to see all objects closer than this distance up to a distance D. Then, the focal length of the required convex lens is <i class="calibre33"><span class="calibre28">  </span></i>f equal to d times D by d minus D. equation 2.8</p>
	<p class="block_12">Presbyopia</p>
	<p class="block_">Due to ageing, ciliary muscles become weak and the eye-lens become rigid (inflexible) and so the eye loses its power of accommodation.</p>
	<p class="block_">Because of this, an aged person cannot see the nearby objects clearly. So, it is also called as ‘old age hypermetropia’.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Some persons may have both the defects of vision - myopia as well as hypermetropia. This can be corrected by ‘bifocal lenses’ in which, upper part consists of concave lens (to correct myopia) used for distant vision and the lower part consists of convex lens (to correct hypermetropia) used for reading purposes.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Astigmatism</p>
	<p class="block_9">In this defect, eye cannot see parallel and horizontal lines clearly. It may be inherited or acquired. It is due to the imperfect structure of eye lens because of the development of cataract on the lens, ulceration of cornea, injury to the refracting surfaces, etcetera. Astigmatism can be corrected by using cylindrical lenses. </p>

	<p class="block_">1. Simple microscope</p>
	<p class="block_">2. Compound microscope</p>
	<p class="block_12">Simple Microscope</p>
	<p class="block_">Simple microscope has a convex lens of short focal length. It is held near the eye to get enlarged image of small object Let an object (A B) is placed at a point within the principal focus (u less than f) of the convex lens and the observer’s eye is placed just behind the lens.</p>
	<p class="block_74"><img src="images/image-37.png" alt="This is a figure about simple microscope  f" class="calibre65"/></p>
	<p class="block_">As per this position the convex lens produces an erect, virtual and enlarged image A dash b dash. The image formed is in the same side of the object and the distance equal to the least distance of distinct vision (D) (For normal human eye D = 25 cm).</p>
	<p class="block_12">Uses of Simple microscope </p>
	<p class="block_74">Simple microscopes are used</p>
	<p class="block_74">a) by watch repairers and jewellers.</p>
	<p class="block_74">b) to read small letters clearly.</p>
	<p class="block_74">c) to observe parts of flower, insects etc.</p>
	<p class="block_74">d) to observe finger prints in the field of forensic science.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Compound microscope</p>
	<p class="block_9">Compound microscope is also used to see the tiny objects. It has better magnification power than simple microscope. Magnification power of microscopes can be increased by decreasing the focal length of the lens used. Due to constructional limitations, the focal length of the lens cannot be decreased beyond certain limit. This problem can be solved by using two separate biconvex lenses.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Construction</p>
	<p class="block_">A compound microscope consists of two convex lenses. The lens with the shorter focal length is placed near the object, and is called as ‘objective lens’ or ‘objective piece’. The lens with larger focal length and larger aperture placed near the observer’s eye is called as ‘eye lens’ or ‘eye piece’. Both the lenses are fixed in a narrow tube with adjustable provision.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Working</p>
	<p class="block_">The object (AB) is placed at a distance slightly greater than the focal length of objective lens (u &gt;of) u greater than fo. A real, inverted and magnified image (A'B') is formed at the other side of the objective lens.</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-38.png" alt="Image formation in compound microscope figure is given " class="calibre66"/></p>
	<p class="block_">This image behaves as the object for the eye lens. The position of the eye lens is adjusted in such a way, that the image (A'B') A dash B dash falls within the principal focus of the eye piece. This eye piece forms a virtual, enlarged and erect image (A" B") A double dash B double dash on the same side of the object</p>
	<p class="block_">Compound microscope has 50 to 200 times more magnification power than simple microscope</p>
	<p class="block_">Travelling Microscope</p>
	<p class="block_">A travelling microscope is one of the best instruments for measuring very small length with high degree of accuracy at the order of 0.01mm. It works based on the principle of vernier. Its least count is 0.01 mm.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_56">2.19 TELESCOPE</h2>
	<p class="block_9">Have you seen the recent lunar eclipse? With our naked eye we can’t visualize the phenomena distinctly. Then, how can we see the distant object in clearer manner? It is possible with telescope.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Telescope is an optical instrument to see the distant objects. The first telescope was invented by Johann Lippershey in 1608. Galileo made a telescope to observe distant stars. He got the idea, from a spectacle maker who one day observed that the distant weather cock appeared magnified through his lens system fitted in his shop. Galileo observed the satellites of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn through his telescope. Kepler invented Telescope in1611 which was fundamentally similar to the astronomical telescope.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Types of Telescopes</p>
	<p class="block_12">According to optical property, it is classified into two groups:</p>
	<p class="block_">one) refracting telescope two) reflecting telescope</p>
	<p class="block_">In refracting telescope lenses are used. Galilean telescope, Keplerian telescope, Achromatic refractors, are some refracting telescopes.</p>
	<p class="block_">In reflecting telescope parabolic mirrors are used Gregorian, Newtonian, Cassegrain telescope are some Reflecting telescopes According to the things which are observed, Astronomical Telescope and Terrestrial Telescopes are the two major types of telescopes.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Astronomical Telescope</p>
	<p class="block_">An astronomical telescope is used to view heavenly bodies like stars, planets galaxies and satellites.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Terrestrial Telescopes</p>
	<p class="block_">The image in an astronomical telescope is inverted. So, it is not suitable for viewing objects on the surface of the Earth .There fore, a terrestrial telescope is used. It provides an erect image. The major difference between astronomical and terrestrial telescope is erecting the final image with respect to the object.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Advantages of Telescopes</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_66">Elaborate view of the Galaxies, Planets, stars and other heavenly bodies is possible.</li>
	<li class="block_66">Camera can be attached for taking photograph for the celestial objects.</li>
	<li class="block_66">Telescope can be viewed even with the low intensity of light.</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_19">Disadvantages</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_66">Frequent maintenances needed.</li>
	<li class="block_66">It is not easily portable one.</li>
</ol>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_57">Points to Remember</h2>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_6">Light is a form of energy which travels along a straight line</li>
	<li class="block_7">The deviation in the path of light ray is called refraction.</li>
	<li class="block_7">The ratio of speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in a medium is defined as refractive index ‘μ’ of that medium.</li>
	<li class="block_7">The ability of the eye to focus nearby as well as the distant objects is called power of accommodation of the eye.</li>
	<li class="block_7">A microscope is an optical instrument which helps us to see the objects which are very small in dimension.</li>
	<li class="block_8"> Telescope is an optical instrument used to see the distant objects clearly.</li>
</ol>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_58">SOLVED PROBLEMS</h2>

	<p class="block_">Sun is the primary source of thermal energy for all living organisms. Thermal energy is the cause and temperature are the effect. All living organisms need a particular temperature for their survival. In the kitchen, a container with a steel bottom is placed on the induction stove. Do you know why? All of us have a common man’s understanding of thermal energy and temperature. But, in this chapter, you shall learn about thermal energy and temperature in a scientific manner. We shall also discuss about how thermal energy is transferred and the effects of thermal energy.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_63">3.1 TEMPERATURE</h2>
	<p class="block_">Temperature is defined as the degree of hotness of a body. The temperature is higher for a hotter body than for a colder body. It is also be defined as the property which determines whether a body is in equilibrium or not with the surroundings. (Or<span class="calibre28"> average kinetic energy of the molecules). Further, temperature is the property, which determines the direction of flow of heat. It is   a scalar quantity. The SI unit of temperature   is kelvin (K).

	<p class="block_">The temperature measured in relation to absolute zero using the kelvin scale is known as absolute<span class="calibre28">  scale</span> temperature. It is also known as the thermodynamic temperature. Each unit of the thermodynamic scale of temperature is defined as the fraction of 1by273.16th part of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water. A temperature difference of 1°C is equal to that of 1Kelvin. Zero Kelvin is the absolute scale of tempter of the body.</p>
	<p class="block_">The relation between the different types of scale of temperature:</p>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_65">3.1.2 Thermal equilibrium</h3>
	<p class="block_">Two or more physical systems or bodies are said to be in thermal equilibrium if there is no net flow of thermal energy between the systems. Heat energy always flows from one body to the other due to a temperature difference between them. Thus, you can define thermal equilibrium in another way. If two bodies are said to be in thermal equilibrium, then, they will be at the same temperature. What will happen if two bodies at different temperatures are brought in contact with one other? There will be a transfer of heat energy from the hot body to the cold body until a thermal equilibrium is established between them. This is depicted in Figure 3.1.</p>

	<p class="block_">When a cold body is placed in contact with a hot body, some thermal energy is transferred from the hot body to the cold body. As a result, there is some rise in the temperature of the cold body and decrease in the temperature of the hot body. This process will continue until these two bodies attain the same temperature.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_66">3.2 THERMAL ENERGY</h2>
	<p class="block_">If you leave a cup of hot milk on a table for some time, what happens? The hotness of the milk decreases after some time. Similarly, if you keep a bottle of cold water on a table, the water becomes warmer after some time. What do you infer from these observations? In the case of hot milk, there is a flow of energy from the cup of milk to the environment. In the second case, the energy is transferred from the environment to the water bottle. This energy is termed as “thermal energy”.</p>
	<p class="block_">When a hot object is in contact with another cold object, a form of energy flows from the hot object to the cold object, which is known as thermal energy. Thus, thermal energy is a form of energy which is transferred between any two bodies due to the difference in their temperatures. Thermal energy is also known as 'heat energy' or simply 'heat'.</p>
	<p class="block_">Heat energy is the agent, which produces the sensation of warmth and makes bodies hot. The process in which heat energy flows from a body at a higher temperature to another object at lower temperature is known as heating. This process of transmission of heat may be done in any of the ways like conduction, convection or radiation. Heat is a scalar quantity. The SI unit of heat energy absorbed or evolved is joule (J) </p>
	<p class="block_">During the process of transferring heat energy, the body at lower temperature is heated while the body at higher temperature is cooled. Thus, sometimes, this process of transfer of heat energy is termed as 'cooling'. But, in most of the cases the term 'heating' is used instead of 'cooling'. When the thermal energy is transferred from one body to another, this results in the rise or lowering of the temperature of either of the bodies.</p>

	<p class="block_">When heat energy is supplied to a body, there can be an increase in the dimension of the object. This change in the dimension due to rise in temperature is called thermal expansion of the object. The expansion of liquids (example  mercury) can be seen when a thermometer is placed in warm water. All forms of matter (solid, liquid and gas) undergo expansion on heating.</p>
	<h4 class="block_103">a) Expansion in solids</h4>
	<p class="block_">When a solid is heated, the atoms gain energy and vibrate more vigorously. This results in the expansion of the solid. For a given change in temperature, the extent of expansion is smaller in solids than in liquids and gases. This is due to the rigid nature of solids.</p>
	<p class="block_">The different types of expansion of solid are listed and explained below:</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_6">Linear expansion</li>
	<li class="block_7">Superficial expansion</li>
	<li class="block_8">Cubical expansion</li>
</ol>
	<h5 class="block_15">1. Linear expansion:</h5>
	<p class="block_">When a body is heated or cooled, the length of the body changes due to change in its temperature. Then the expansion is said to be linear or longitudinal expansion.</p>
	<p class="block_">The ratio of increase in length of the body per degree rise in temperature to its unit length is called as the coefficient of linear expansion. The SI unit of Coefficient of Linear expansion is Kelvin power minus one . The value of coefficient of linear expansion is different for different materials.</p>

	<p class="block_">As in the cases of linear and areal expansion, cubical expansion is also expressed in terms of coefficient of cubical expansion.

	<h4 class="block_103">b) Expansion in liquids and gases</h4>
	<p class="block_">When heated, the atoms in a liquid or gas gain energy and are forced further apart. The extent of expansion varies from substance to substance. For a given rise in temperature, a liquid will have more expansion than a solid and a gaseous substance has the highest expansion when compared with the other two. The coefficient of cubical expansion of liquid is independent of temperature whereas its value for gases depends on the temperature of gases.</p>
	<p class="block_">When a liquid is heated, it is done by keeping the liquid in some container and supplying heat energy to the liquid through the container. The thermal energy supplied will be partly used in expanding the container and partly used in expanding the liquid. Thus, what we observe may not be the actual or real expansion of the liquid. Hence, for liquids, we can define real expansion and apparent expansion.</p>
	<h5 class="block_15">1) Real expansion</h5>
	<h5 class="block_110"> </h5>
	<p class="block_">If a liquid is heated directly without using any container, then the expansion that you observe is termed as <b class="calibre6">real expansion</b> of the liquid.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Coefficient of real expansion</b> is defined as the ratio of the true rise in the volume of the liquid per degree rise in temperature to its unit volume. The SI unit of coefficient of real expansion is Kelvin power minus one.</p>
	<h5 class="block_15">2) Apparent expansion</h5>
	<h5 class="block_110"> </h5>
	<p class="block_">Heating a liquid without using a container is not possible. Thus, in practice, you can heat any liquid by pouring it in a container. A part of thermal energy is used in expanding the container and a part is used in expanding the liquid. Thus, what you observe is not the actual or real expansion of the liquid. The expansion of a liquid apparently observed without considering the expansion of the container is called the apparent expansion of the liquid.</p>
	<p class="block_">Coefficient of apparent expansion is defined as the ratio of the apparent rise in the volume of the liquid per degree rise in temperature to its unit volume. The SI unit of coefficient of apparent expansion is Kelvin power minus one.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_71">3.3.2 Experiment to measure real and apparent expansion of liquid</h3>
	<p class="block_">To start with, the liquid whose real and apparent expansion is to be determined is poured in a container up to a level. Mark this level as L1. Now, heat the container and the liquid using a burner as shown in the Figure 3.5. Initially, the container receives the thermal energy and it expands. As a result, the volume of the liquid appears to have reduced. Mark this reduced level of liquid as L2.</p>
	<p class="block_">On further heating, the thermal energy supplied to the liquid through the container results in the expansion of the liquid. Hence, the level of liquid rises to L3. Now, the difference between the levels L1 and L3 is called as <b class="calibre6">apparent expansion</b>, and the difference between the levels L2 and L3 is called real expansion. The real expansion is always more than that of <b class="calibre6">apparent expansion.</b></p>

	<p class="block_">If the molecules or atoms of gases interact with each other with a definite amount of intermolecular or inter atomic force of attraction, then the gases are said to be real gases. At very high temperature or low pressure, a real gas behaves as an ideal gas because in this condition there is no interatomic or intermolecular force of attraction.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_79">3.5.2 Ideal Gases</h3>

	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">Actually, in practice, no gas is ideal.  The molecules of any gas will have a certain amount of interaction among them. But these interactions are weaker when the pressure is low or the temperature is high because the interatomic or intermolecular forces of attraction are weak in ideal gas. Hence, a real gas at low pressure or high temperature can be termed as a perfect gas.</span></p>
	<p class="block_">Ideal gases obey Boyle’s law, Charles’s law and Avogadro’s law. All these laws state the relationship between various properties of a gas such as pressure (P), volume (V), temperature(T) and number of atoms (n).

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_94">INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p class="block_">You have already learnt about electricity in your lower classes, haven’t you? Well, electricity deals with the flow of electric charges through a conductor. As a common term it refers to a form of energy. The usage of electric current in our day-to-day life is very important and indispensable. You are already aware of the fact that it is used in houses, educational in situations, hospitals, industries, etcetera. Therefore, its generation and transmission become a very crucial aspect of our life. In this lesson you will learn various terms used in understanding the concept of electricity. Eventually, you will realise the importance of the applications of electricity in day-to-day situations.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_95">4.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT </h2>
	<p class="block_9">The motion of electric charges (electrons) through a conductor (example, copper wire) will constitute an electric current. This is similar to the flow of water through a channel or flow of air from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure. In a similar manner, the electric current passes from the positive terminal (higher electric potential) of a battery to the negative terminal (lower electric potential) through a wire as shown in the Figure 4.1</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image477.jpeg" alt=" A picture representing Electron flow is given" class="calibre87"/></p>
	<p class="block_12">Figure 4.1 Electron flow</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_96">4.1.1 Definition of electric current</h3>
	<p class="block_">Electric current is often termed as ‘current’ and it is represented by the symbol ‘I’. It is defined as the rate of flow of charges in a conductor. This means that the electric current represents the amount of charges flowing in any cross section of a conductor (say a metal wire) in unit time. If a net charge ‘Q’ passes through any cross section of a conductor in time ‘t’, then the current flowing through the conductor is  I is equal to Q by T equation 4.1</p>
	<p class="block_">4.1.2 <b class="calibre6">SI unit of electric current</b></p>
	<p class="block_">The SI unit of electric current is ampere (A). The current flowing through a conductor is said to be one ampere, when a charge of one coulomb flows across any cross-section of a conductor, in one second. Hence, 1 ampere is equal to one coulomb divided by one second.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Solved Problem 1</p>
	<p class="block_">A charge of 12 coulomb flows through a bulb in 5 second. What is the current through the bulb?</p>
	<p class="block_">Solution:</p>
	<p class="block_">Charge Q = 12 Coulomb, Time t = 5 second. Therefore, current I = Q by t = 12 by 5 = 2.4 Amphere</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_97">4.2 ELECTRIC CIRCUIT</h2>
	<p class="block_">An electric circuit is a closed conducting loop (or) path, which has a network of electrical components through which electrons are able to flow. This path is made using electrical wires so as to connect an electric appliance to a source of electric charges (battery). A schematic diagram of an electric circuit comprising of a battery, an electric bulb, and a switch is given in Figure 4.2.</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image596.jpeg" alt="A simple electric circuit- Explained in the text book " class="calibre95"/></p>
	<p class="block_12">Figure 4.2 A simple electric circuit</p>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">In this circuit, if the switch is ‘on’, the bulb glows. If it is switched off, the bulb does not glow. Therefore, the circuit must be closed in order that the current passes through it.  The potential difference required for the flow of charges is provided by the battery. The electrons flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal of the battery.</span></p>
	<p class="block_">By convention, the direction of current is taken as the direction of flow of positive charge (or) opposite to the direction of flow of electrons. Thus, electric current passes in the circuit from the positive terminal to the negative terminal.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_98">4.2.1 Electrical components</h3>
	<p class="block_18"> </p>
	<p class="block_9">The electric circuit given in Figure4.2 consists of different components, such as a battery, a switch and a bulb. All these components can be represented by using certain symbols. It is easier to represent the components of a circuit using their respective symbols.</p>
	<p class="block_9">The symbols that are used to represent some commonly used components are given in Table 4.1. The uses of these components are also summarized in the table.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_99">4.3 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE</h2>
	<p class="block_9">You are now familiar with the water current and air current. You also know that there must be a difference in temperature between two points in a solid for the heat to flow in it. Similarly, a difference in electric potential is needed for the flow of electric charges in a conductor. In the conductor, the charges will flow from a point in it, which is at a higher electric potential to a point, which is at a lower electric potential.</p>
	<p class="block_19">4.3.1 Electric Potential</p>
	<p class="block_9">The electric potential at a point is defined as the amount of work done in moving a unit positive charge from infinity to that point against the electric force.</p>
	<p class="block_19">4.3.2 Electric Potential Difference</p>
	<p class="block_9">The electric potential difference between two points is defined as the amount of work done in moving a unit positive charge from one point to another point against the electric force.</p>
	<p class="block_9"> </p>
	<p class="block_9"><img src="images/image-55.png" alt="This is a picture . It describes electric potential. There are two charges one is kept at A and another at B at a distance." class="calibre96"/></p>
	<p class="block_19">Figure 4.3 Electric potential </p>
	<p class="block_9">Suppose <span class="calibre15">you have moved a charge Q from a point A to another point B. Let ‘W’    be the work done to move the charge from A to B. Then, the potential difference between the points A and B is given by the following expression:</span></p>
	<p class="block_137">Potential difference V is equal to Work done divided by Charge<span class="calibre15">  </span>equation 4.2</p>
	<p class="block_9">Potential difference is also equal to the difference in the electric potential of these two points. If VA and VB represent the electric potential at the points A and B respectively, then, the potential difference between the points A and B is given by:</p>
	<p class="block_9">V = VA minus VB (if VA is more than VB) </p>
	<p class="block_9">V = VB minus VA (if VB is more than VA)</p>
	<p class="block_19">4.3.3 Volt</p>
	<p class="block_9">The SI unit of electric potential or potential difference is volt (V) The potential difference between two points is one volt, if one joule of work is done in moving one coulomb of charge from one point to another against the electric force.</p>
	<p class="block_">1volt = one joule by one coulomb</p>
	<p class="block_12">Solved Problem 2</p>
	<p class="block_">The work done in moving a charge of 10 Coulomb across two points in a circuit is 100 Joule. What is the potential difference between the points?</p>
	<p class="block_">Solution:</p>
	<p class="block_">Charge, Q = 10 Coulomb Work Done, W = 100 Joule</p>
	<p class="block_"> Potential Difference V = W by Q is equal to 100 by 10</p>
	<p class="block_">Therefore, V = 10 volt</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_100">4.4 OHM’S LAW</h2>
	<p class="block_">A German physicist, George Simon Ohm established the relation between the potential difference and current, which is known as Ohm’s Law. This relationship can be understood from the following activity<b class="calibre6">.</b></p>
	<p class="block_138"><img src="images/image612.jpeg" alt="Electric circuit to understand Ohm’s law - Explained  in text book " class="calibre97"/></p>
	<p class="block_12">Figure 4.4 Electric circuit to understand Ohm’s law</p>
	<p class="block_9">According to Ohm’s law, at a constant temperature, the steady current ‘I’ flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference ‘V’ between the two ends of the conductor.</p>
	<p class="block_139">I proportional to V. Hence, I by V is equal to constant</p>
	<p class="block_140">The value of this proportionality constant is found to be one by R</p>
	<p class="block_141">Therefore, I is equal to open bracket 1 by R close bracket V</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6"> V = I R<span class="tab">      </span></b><b class="calibre6">equation  (4.3)</b></p>
	<p class="block_">Here, R is a constant for a given material (say Nichrome) at a given temperature and is known as the resistance of the material. Since, the potential difference V is proportional to the current I, the graph between V and I is a straight line for a conductor, as shown in the Figure 4.5.</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_101">4.5 RESISTANCE OF A MATERIAL:</h2>
	<p class="block_">In Figure 4.4, a Nichrome wire was connected between X and Y. If you replace the Nichrome wire with a copper wire and c<span class="calibre28">onduct the same experiment, you will notice a different current for the same value   of the potential difference across the wire.  If you again replace the copper wire with an aluminium wire, you will get another value for the current passing through it. From equation (4.3), you have learnt that V</span> by I must be equal to the resistance of the conductor used. The variations in the current for the same values of potential difference indicate that the resistance of different materials is different. Now, the primary question is, “what is resistance?”</p>
	<p class="block_">Resistance of a material is its property to oppose the flow of charges and hence the passage of current through it. It is different for different materials.</p>
	<p class="block_">From Ohm’s Law V by I is equal to R</p>
	<p class="block_">The resistance of a conductor can be defined as the ratio between the potential difference across the ends of the conductor and the current flowing through it.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_102">4.5.1 Unit of Resistance</h3>
	<p class="block_">The SI unit of resistance is ohm and it is represented by the symbol Ω.(ohm)</p>
	<p class="block_">Resistance of a conductor is said to be one ohm if a current of one ampere flows through it when a potential difference of one volt is maintained across its ends.</p>
	<p class="block_">1 ohm <span class="calibre28"> is equal to  one volt by one ampere</span></p>
	<p class="block_12">Solved Problem 3</p>
	<p class="block_">Calculate the resistance of a conductor through which a current of 2 Ampere passes, when the potential difference between its ends is 30 Volt.</p>
	<p class="block_">Solution:</p>
	<p class="block_">Current through the conductor I = 2 Ampere, Potential Difference V = 30 Volt</p>
	<p class="block_">From Ohm’s Law: R is equal to V by I</p>
	<p class="block_">Therefore, R = 30 by 2 is equal to 15 ohm</p>

	<p class="block_">So far, you have learnt how the resistance of a conductor affects the current through a circuit. You have also studied the case of the simple electric circuit containing a single resistor. Now in practice, you may encounter a complicated circuit, which uses a combination of many resistors. This combination of resistors is known as ‘system of resistors’ or ‘grouping of resistors. Resistors can be connected in various combinations. The two basic methods of joining resistors together are:</p>
	<p class="block_">a) Resistors connected in series, and b) Resistors connected in parallel.</p>
	<p class="block_">In the following sections, you shall compute the effective resistance when many resistors having different resistance values are connected in series and in parallel.</p>

	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">A series circuit connects the components one after the other to form a ‘single loop’. A series circuit has only one loop through which current can pass. If the circuit is interrupted    at any point in the loop, no current can pass through the circuit and hence no electric appliances connected in the circuit will work. Series circuits are commonly used in devices such as flashlights. Thus, if resistors are connected end to end, so that the same current passes through each of them, then they are said to be connected in series</span><b class="calibre6">.</b></p>

	<p class="block_9"><span class="calibre15">Have you ever touched the motor casing of a fan, which has been used for a few hours continuously? What do you observe? The motor casing is warm. This is due to the heating effect of current. The same can be observed by touching a bulb, which was used for a long duration. Generally, a source of electrical energy can develop a potential difference across a resistor, which is connected to that source. This potential difference constitutes a current through the resistor. For continuous drawing of current, the source has to continuously spend its energy. A part of the energy from the source can be converted into useful work and the rest will be converted into heat energy. Thus, the passage of electric current through   a wire, results in the production of heat. This phenomenon is called heating effect of current. This heating effect of current is used in devices like electric heater, electric iron, etc</span>etera.</p>

Similarly, the electric power is defined as the rate of consumption of electrical energy. It represents the rate at which the electrical energy is converted into some other form of energy.</span></p>
	<p class="block_9">Suppose a current ‘I’ flows through a conductor of resistance ‘R’ for a time ‘t’, then the potential difference across the two ends of the conductor is ‘V’. The work done ‘W’ to move the charge across the ends of the conductor is given by the equation (4.19) as follows:</p>

Electrical energy consumed is taken as the product of electric power and time of usage. For example, if 100 watt of electric power is <span class="calibre15">consumed for two hours, then the power consumed is100 × 2 = 200watt hour. Consumption of electrical energy is measured and expressed in watt hour, though its SI unit is watt second. In practice, a larger unit of electrical energy   is needed. This larger unit is kilowatt hour (kWh). One kilowatt hour is otherwise known as one unit of electrical energy. One kilowatt hour means that an electric power of 1000 watt has been utilized for an hour. Hence,</span></p>

	<p class="block_9"><span class="calibre15">one wire has a red insulation and is called the ‘live wire’. The other wire has a black insulation and is called the ‘neutral wire’.  The electricity supplied to your house is actually an alternating current having an electric potential of 220 V</span>olt<span class="calibre15">. Both, the live wire and the neutral wire enter into a box where   the main fuse is connected with the live wire. After the electricity meter, these wires enter into the main switch, which is used to discontinue the electricity supply whenever required. After the main switch, these wires are connected to live wires of two separate circuits. Out of these two circuits, one circuit is of a 5 A</span>mpere rating, which is used to run the electric appliances with a lower power rating, such as tube lights, bulbs and fans. The other circuit is of a 15 Ampere <span class="calibre15">rating, which is used to   run electric appliances with a </span>high-power rating, such as air-conditioners, refrigerators, <span class="calibre15">electric iron and heaters. It should be noted that all the circuits in a house are connected   in parallel, so that the disconnection of one circuit does not affect the other circuit. One more advantage of the parallel connection of circuits is that each electric appliance gets an equal voltage.</span></p>
	<p class="block_9">Do you know?</p>
	<p class="block_">In India domestic circuits are supplied with an alternating current of potential 220 or 230 volt. And frequency 50 hertz. In countries like U S A and U K domestic circuits are supplied with an alternating current of potential of 110 or 120 volt and frequency of 60 hertz.</p>
	<h3 class="block_11" id="toc_id_118">4.10.1 Overloading and Short circuiting</h3>
	<p class="block_">The fuse wire or MCB will disconnect the circuit in the event of an overloading and short circuiting. Over loading happens when a large number of appliances are connected in series to the same source of electric power. This leads to a flow of excess current in the electric circuit.</p>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">When the amount of current passing through   a wire exceeds the maximum permissible limit, the wires get heated to such an extent that a fire may be caused. This is known as overloading. When a live wire comes in contact with a neutral wire, it causes a ‘short circuit’. This happens when the insulation of the wires </span>gets damaged due to temperature changes or some external force. Due to a short circuit, the effective resistance in the circuit becomes very small, which leads to the flow of a large current through the wires. This results in heating of wires to such an extent that a fire may be caused in the building.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_119">4.10.2 Earthing</h3>
	<p class="block_">In domestic circuits, a third wire called the earth wire having a green insulation is usually connected to the body of the metallic electric appliance. The other end of the earth wire is connected to a metal tube or a metal electrode, which is buried into the Earth. This wire provides a low resistance path to the electric current. The earth wire sends the current from the body of the appliance to the Earth, whenever a live wire accidentally touches the body of the metallic electric appliance. Thus, the earth wire serves as a protective conductor, which saves us from electric shocks.</p>

	<p class="block_">An LED bulb is a semiconductor device that emits visible light when an electric current passes through it. The colour of the emitted light will depend on the type of materials used. With the help of the chemical compounds like Gallium Arsenide and Gallium Phosphide, the manufacturer can produce LED bulbs that radiates red, green, yellow and orange colours. Displays in digital watches and calculators, traffic signals, street lights, decorative lights, etcetera., are some examples for the use of LEDs.</p>

	<p class="block_">LED Television is one of the most important applications of Light Emitting Diodes. An LED TV is actually an LCD TV (Liquid Crystal Display) with LED display. An LED display uses LEDs for backlight and an array of LEDs act as pixels. LEDs emitting white light are used in monochrome (black and white) TV; Red, Green and Blue (RGB) LEDs are used in colour television. The first LED television screen was developed by James. Mitchell in 1977. It was a monochromatic display. But, after about three decades, in 2009, SONY introduced the first commercial LED Television.</p>

	<p class="block_">1. Two bulbs are having the ratings as 60 Watt, 220 Volt and 40 Watt, 220 Volt respectively. Which one has a greater resistance?</p>
	<p class="block_12">Solution: </p>
	<p class="block_">Electric power  P is equal to V square by R</p>
	<p class="block_">For the same value of V, R is inversely proportional to P.</p>
	<p class="block_">Therefore, lesser the power, greater the resistance</p>
	<p class="block_">Hence, the bulb with 40 Watt, 220 Volt rating has a greater resistance.</p>
	<p class="block_">2. Calculate the current and the resistance of a 100 Watt, 200 Volt electric bulb in an electric circuit.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Solution: </p>
	<p class="block_">Power P = 100 Watt and Voltage V = 200 Volt Power P = V into I</p>
	<p class="block_">So, Current, I = P by V equal to 100 by 200 equal to 0.5 ampere</p>
	<p class="block_">Resistance, R is equal to V by I is equal to 200 by 0.5 is equal to 400 ohm.</p>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">3. In the circuit diagram given below, three resistors R1, R2 and R3 of 5 Ω, 10 Ω and   20 Ω respectively are connected as shown. Calculate:</span></p>
	<p class="block_12"><img src="images/image665.jpeg" alt="circuit diagram GIVEN" class="calibre109"/></p>

	<p class="block_172">B. Total current in the circuit</p>
	<p class="block_172">C. Total resistance in the circuit</p>
	<p class="block_">Solution:</p>
	<p class="block_173">A. Since the resistors are connected in parallel, the potential difference across each resistor is same (that is V =10 Volt) Therefore, the current through R 1 is,</p>
	<p class="block_61">I<sub class="calibre25"> </sub>1<span class="calibre28"> =  </span> V by R1 is equal to 10 by five is equal to 2 Ampere</p>
	<p class="block_61">Current through R<sub class="calibre25"> </sub>2 = I<sub class="calibre25"> </sub>2 = V by R2 equal to ten by ten equal to one ampere. </p>
	<p class="block_61">Current through R3 equal to I 3 equal to V by R3 equal to ten by twenty is equal to 0.5 ampere.</p>
	<p class="block_174">B. Total current in the circuit,<sub class="calibre25"> </sub> I is equal to I one plus I two plus I three</p>
	<p class="block_175">= 2 + 1 + 0.5 = 3.5 ampere<span class="calibre15">  </span></p>
	<p class="block_174">C. Total resistance in the circuit 1 by R p = 1 by R 1 + 1 by R 2 + 1 by R 3</p>
	<p class="block_174">= 1 by 5. + 1 by 10. + 1 by 20. = 4 + 2 + 1 divided by 20.</p>
	<p class="block_174">1 by R p = 7 by 20</p>
	<p class="block_174">Hence R p = 20 by 7 = 2.857 ohm.</p>
	<p class="block_176">4. Three resistors of 1 ohm, 2 ohm and 4 ohm are connected in parallel in a circuit. If a 1 ohm resistor draws a current of 1 A, find the current through the other two resistors.</p>
	<p class="block_">Solution:</p>
	<p class="block_177">R<sub class="calibre25">1</sub>=1 ohm, R<sub class="calibre25">2</sub>=2 ohm, R<sub class="calibre25">3</sub>=4 ohm Current I 1 = 1A<span class="calibre15">   R one is equal to 1 ohm, R2 is equal to 4 ohm R3 is equal to 4 ohm current I1 is equal to one ampere</span></p>
	<p class="block_178">The potential difference across the 1 Ω resistor</p>
	<p class="block_179">I one R one equal to one into one equal to one volt</p>
	<p class="block_180">Since, the resistors are connected in parallel in the circuit, the same potential difference will exist across the other resistors also.</p>
	<p class="block_61">So, the current in the 2 ohm resistor,<span class="calibre28">  V by R2 is equal to one by two is equal to zero point five ampere.</span></p>
	<p class="block_181">Similarly, the current in the 4 ohm resistor,</p>
	<p class="block_61"> V by R3 equal to one by four equal to zero point two five ampere.</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_133">INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">Sound plays a major role in our lives. We communicate with each other mainly through sound.  In our daily life, we hear a variety of sounds produced by different sources like humans, animals, vehicle horns, etc</span>etera<span class="calibre28">. Hence, it becomes inevitable to understand how sound is produced, how it is propagated and how you hear the sound from various sources. It is sometimes misinterpreted that acoustics only deals with musical instruments and design of auditoria and concert halls. But acoustics is a branch   of physics that deals with production, transmission, reception, control, and effects of sound. You have studied about propagation and properties of sound waves in </span>ninth<span class="calibre28"> standard. In this lesson we will study about reflection   of sound waves, Echo and Doppler effect.</span></p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_134">5.1 SOUND WAVES</h2>
	<p class="block_">When you think about sound, the questions that arise in your minds are: How is sound produced? How does sound reach our ears from various sources? What is sound? Is it a force or energy? Let us answer all these questions.</p>
	<p class="block_74"><img src="images/image693.jpeg" alt=" Production of sound waves- Explained in the text book " class="calibre113"/></p>
	<p class="block_138"> Figure 5.1 Production of sound waves</p>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">By touching a ringing bell or a musical instrument while it is producing music, you can conclude that sound is produced by vibrations. The vibrating bodies produce energy in the form of waves, which are nothing but sound waves (Figure 5.1). Suppose you and your friend are on the Moon. Will you be able to hear any sound produced by your friend? As the Moon does not have air, you will not be able to hear any sound produced by your friend. Hence, you understand that the sound   produced   due to the vibration of different bodies needs a material medium like air, water, steel, etc</span>etera, for its propagation. Hence, sound can propagate through a gaseous medium or a liquid medium or a solid medium.</p>
	<p class="block_12">ACTIVITY 1</p>
	<p class="block_">Take a squeaky toy or old mobile phone and put it inside a plastic bag. Seal the bag with the help of a candle or with a thread. Fill a bucket with water and place the bag in the water bucket and squeeze the toy or ring the mobile. You will hear a low sound. Now place your ear against the side of the bucket and squeeze the toy or ring the mobile phone again. You will hear a louder sound.</p>

	<p class="block_">Sound waves are longitudinal waves that can travel through any medium (solids, liquids, gases) with a speed that depends on the properties of the medium. As sound travels through a medium, the particles of the medium vibrate along the direction of propagation of the wave. This displacement involves the longitudinal displacements of the individual molecules from their mean positions. This results in a series of high- and low-pressure regions called compressions and rarefactions as shown in figure 5.2.</p>

	<h3 class="block_11" id="toc_id_139">5.1.4 Velocity of sound waves</h3>
	<p class="block_9">When you talk about the velocity associated with any wave, there are two velocities, namely particle velocity and wave velocity.  SI unit of velocity is m<span class="calibre15">etre  second power minus one.</span>.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Particle velocity:</p>
	<p class="block_9">The velocity with which the particles of the medium vibrate in order to transfer the energy in the form of a wave is called particle velocity.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Wave velocity:</p>
	<p class="block_9">The velocity with which the wave travels through the medium is called wave velocity. In other words, the distance travelled by a sound wave in unit time is called the velocity of a sound wave.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Velocity = distance travelled by time</p>
	<p class="block_61">If the distance travelled by one wave is taken as one wavelength (λ) and, the time taken for this propagation is one time period (T), then, the expression for velocity can be written as</p>
	<p class="block_206">Therefore  V is equal to lambta by T equation 5.1</p>
	<p class="block_23">Therefore, velocity can be defined as the distance travelled per second by a sound wave. Since, Frequency (n) is equal to 1, equation (5.1) can be written as</p>
	<p class="block_23"> V = n λ equation (5.2)</p>
	<p class="block_9">Velocity of a sound wave is maximum in solids because they are more elastic in nature than liquids and gases. Since, gases are least elastic in nature, the velocity of sound is the least in a gaseous medium.</p>
	<p class="block_9">So, v S<sub class="calibre25"> </sub>greater than v L greater than V G </p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_140">5.1.5 Factors affecting velocity of sound</h3>
	<p class="block_9">In the case of solids, the elastic properties and the density of the solids affect the velocity of sound waves. Elastic property of solids is characterized by their elastic moduli. The speed of sound is directly proportional to the square root of the elastic modulus and inversely proportional to the square root of the density. Thus, the velocity of sound in solids decreases as the density increases whereas the velocity of sound increases when the elasticity of the material increases. In the case of gases, the following factors affect the velocity of sound waves.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Effect of density: The velocity of sound in a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of the density of the gas. Hence, the velocity decreases as the density of the gas increases.</p>
	<p class="block_207"><span class="calibre28">V is proportional to square root of one by d  </span></p>
	<p class="block_208"><span class="text_9">Effect of temperature: The velocity of sound in a gas is directly proportional to the square root of its temperature. The velocity of sound in a gas increase with the increase in temperature. V</span><span class="text_10">∝</span><span class="text_9"> √T. Velocity at temperature T is given by the following equation:</span></p>
	<p class="block_61">V T = (v 0 + 0.61 T) meter second power minus one. VT is equal to V0 plus zero point six one T with in the bracket metre second power minus one</p>
	<p class="block_9">Here, V 0 is the velocity of sound in the gas at 0° C. For air, V 0 = 331 meter second power minus one. Hence, the velocity of sound changes by 0.61 metre second power minus one when the temperature changes by one degree Celsius.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Effect of relative humidity: When humidity increases, the speed of sound increases. That is why you can hear sound from long distances clearly during rainy seasons.</p>

	<p class="block_">When you speak in an empty room, you hear a soft repetition of your voice. This is nothing but the reflection of the sound waves that you produce. Let us discuss about the reflection of sound in detail through the following activity.</p>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">When sound waves travel in a given medium and strike the surface of another medium, they can be bounced back into the first medium.  This phenomenon is known as reflection. In simple the reflection and refraction of sound is actually similar to the reflection of light. Thus, the bouncing of sound waves from the interface between two media is termed as the reflection of sound. The waves that strike the interface are termed as the incident wave and the waves that bounce back are termed as the reflected waves, as shown in Figure 5.3</span></p>

	<p class="block_">A longitudinal wave travels in a medium in the form of compressions and rarefactions. Suppose a compression travelling in air from left to right reaches a rigid wall. The compression exerts a force F on the rigid wall. In turn, the wall exerts an equal and opposite reaction R = minus  F on the air molecules. This results in a compression near the rigid wall. Thus, a compression travelling towards the rigid wall is reflected back as a compression. That is the direction of compression is reversed (Figure 5.5).</p>

	<p class="block_">Consider a wave travelling in a solid medium striking on the interface between the solid and the air. The compression exerts a force F on the surface of the rarer medium. As a rarer medium has smaller resistance for any deformation, the surface of separation is pushed backwards (Figure 5.6). As the particles of the rarer medium are free to move, a rarefaction is produced at the interface. Thus, a compression is reflected as a rarefaction and a rarefaction travel from right to left.</p>

	<p class="block_9">When sound waves are reflected from a plane surface, the reflected waves travel in a direction, according to the law of reflection. The intensity of the reflected wave is neither decreased nor increased. But, when the sound waves are reflected from the curved surfaces, the intensity of the reflected waves is changed. When reflected from a convex surface, the reflected waves are diverged out and the intensity is decreased. When sound is reflected from a concave surface, the reflected waves are converged and focused at a point So the intensity of reflected waves is concentrated at a point. Parabolic surfaces are used when it is required to focus the sound at a particular point. Hence, many halls are designed with parabolic reflecting surfaces. In elliptical surfaces, sound from one focus will always be reflected to the other focus, no matter where it strikes the wall.</p>
	<p class="block_9">This principle is used in designing whispering halls. In a whispering hall, the speech of a person standing in one focus can be heard clearly by a listener standing at the other focus. </p>

	<p class="block_9">An echo is the sound reproduced due to the reflection of the original sound from various rigid surfaces such as walls, ceilings, surfaces of mountains, etc.</p>
	<p class="block_9">If you shout or clap near a mountain or near a reflecting surface, like a building you can hear the same sound again. The sound, which you hear is called an echo. It is due to the reflection of sound. One does not experience any echo sound in a small room. This does not mean that sound is not reflected in a small room. This is because smaller rooms do not satisfy the basic conditions for hearing an echo.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_149">5.3.1 Conditions necessary for hearing echo</h3>
	<p class="block_">1. The persistence of hearing for human ears is 0.1 second. This means that you can hear two sound waves clearly, if the time interval between the two sounds is at least 0.1 s. Thus, the minimum time gap between the original sound and an echo must be 0.1 second.</p>
	<p class="block_">2. The above criterion can be satisfied only when the distance between the source of sound and the reflecting surface would satisfy the following equation:</p>
	<p class="block_"> velocity is equal to distance travelled by sound divided by time taken</p>
	<p class="block_"> V is equal to 2d by t</p>
	<p class="block_">d is equal to vt by two</p>
	<p class="block_">Since, t is equal to 0.1 second, then d is equal to v into zero point one divided by two is equal to v  divided by twenty.</p>
	<p class="block_">Thus, the minimum distance required to hear an echo is 1 by <span class="calibre28">20th part of the magnitude    of the velocity of sound in air.

	<p class="block_12">Procedure:</p>
	<p class="block_">1. Measure the distance ‘d’ between the source of sound pulse and the reflecting surface using the measuring tape.</p>
	<p class="block_">2. The receiver is also placed adjacent to the source. A sound pulse is emitted by the source.</p>
	<p class="block_">3. The stopwatch is used to note the time interval between the instant at which the sound pulse is sent and the instant at which the echo is received by the receiver. Note the time interval as ‘t’.</p>
	<p class="block_">4. Repeat the experiment for three or four times. The average time taken for the given number of pulses is calculated.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Calculation of speed of sound:</p>
	<p class="block_">The sound pulse emitted by the source travels a total distance of 2d while travelling from the source to the wall and then back to the receiver.

	<p class="block_9"><span class="calibre15">The whistle of a fast-moving train appears to increase in pitch as it approaches a stationary listener, and it appears to decrease as the train moves away from the listener.  This apparent change in frequency was first observed and explained by Christian Doppler (1803</span> to <span class="calibre15">1853), an Austrian Mathematician and Physicist. He observed that the frequency of the sound as received by a listener is different from the original frequency produced by the source whenever there is a relative motion between the source and the listener. This is known as Doppler effect This relative motion could be due to various possibilities   as follows:</span></p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_231">The listener moves towards or away from a stationary source</li>
	<li class="block_231">The source moves towards or away from a stationary listener</li>

	<p class="block_12">DEFINITION</p>
	<p class="block_">Whenever there is a relative motion between a source and a listener, the frequency of the sound heard by the listener is different from the original frequency of sound emitted by the source. This is known as “Doppler effect”.</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_161">INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">Humans are very much interested in knowing about atoms. Things around us are made up of atoms. A Greek Philosopher 'Democritus' in 400 BC believed that matter is made up of tiny indestructible units called atoms. Later, in 1803, John Dalton considered that elements consist of atoms, which are identical in nature.   J J Thomson discovered cathode rays, known as electrons, experimentally and Goldstein discovered positive rays, which were named as protons by Rutherford.  In 1932, James Chadwick discovered the charge less particles called neutrons. Presently, a large number of elementary particles like photon, meson, positron and neutrino have been discovered. In 1911, the British scientist, Ernest Rutherford explained that the mass of an atom is concentrated in its central part called Nucleus. You have already learnt about the atomic structure in the earlier classes.</span></p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_162">6.1 RADIOACTIVITY</h2>
	<h3 class="block_11" id="toc_id_163">6.1.1 Discovery of radioactivity</h3>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">In 1896, French physicist Henri Becquerel finished his research for the week and stored a certain amount of uranium compound away in a drawer for the week end. By chance, an unexposed photographic plate was also stored in the same drawer. After a week he returned and noticed that the film had been exposed to some radiation. He discovered that he could reproduce the effect whenever he placed uranium near a photographic film. Apparently, uranium radiated something that could affect   a photographic plate. This phenomenon was called as Radioactivity. Uranium was identified to be a radioactive element.</span></p>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">Two years later, the Polish physicist Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie detected radioactivity in 'Pitchblende', a tiny black substance. They were not surprised at the radioactivity of pitchblende, which   is known as an ore of uranium. Later, they discovered that the radiation was more intense from pure uranium. Also, it was found that the pitchblende had less concentration of uranium. They </span>concluded that some other substance was present in pitchblende. After separating this new substance, they discovered that it had unknown chemical properties and it also emitted radiations spontaneously like uranium. They named this new substance as 'Radium'. The radioactive elements emit harmful radioactive radiations like alpha rays or beta rays or gamma rays.</p>
	<h3 class="block_11" id="toc_id_164">6.1.2 Definition of radioactivity</h3>
	<p class="block_9">The nucleus of some elements is unstable. Such nuclei undergo nuclear decay and get converted into more stable nuclei. During this nuclear reaction, these nuclei emit certain harmful radiations and elementary particles. The phenomenon of nuclear decay of certain elements with the emission of radiations like alpha, beta, and gamma rays is called 'radioactivity' and the elements, which undergo this phenomenon are called 'radioactive elements'.</p>
	<h3 class="block_11" id="toc_id_165">6.1.3 Natural Radioactivity</h3>
	<p class="block_9">The elements such as uranium and radium undergo radioactivity and emit the radiations on their own without any human intervention. This phenomenon of spontaneous emission of radiation from certain elements on their own is called 'natural radioactivity'.</p>
	<p class="block_9"><span class="calibre15">The elements   whose   atomic   number is more than 83 undergo spontaneous radioactivity.</span> Example ; uranium, radium, Etcetera. There are only two elements, which have been identified as radioactive substances with atomic number less than 83. They are technetium (Tc) with atomic number 43 and promethium (Pm) with atomic number 61.</p>
	<p class="block_">There have been 29 radioactive substances discovered so far. Most of them are rare earth metals and transition metals.</p>
	<h3 class="block_11" id="toc_id_166">6.1.4 Artificial Radioactivity (or) Induced Radioactivity</h3>
	<p class="block_">The phenomenon by which even light elements are made radioactive, by artificial or induced methods, is called 'artificial radioactivity' or 'man-made radioactivity'.</p>
	<p class="block_">This kind of radioactivity was discovered by Irene Curie and Joliot<span class="calibre28"> in 1934. Artificial radioactivity is induced in certain lighter elements like boron, aluminium etc., by bombarding them with radiations such as 'alpha particles' emitted during the natural radioactivity of uranium.  This also results in the   emission   of   invisible   radiations and elementary particles. During such a disintegration, the nucleus which undergoes disintegration is called 'parent nucleus' and that which is produced after the disintegration is called a 'daughter nucleus'. The particle, which is used to induce the artificial disintegration is termed as projectile and the particle which is produced after the disintegration is termed as ejected particle. When the projectile hits the parent nucleus, it is converted into an unstable nucleus, which in turn decays spontaneously emitting the daughter nucleus along with an ejected particle.</span></p>

	<p class="block_">In 1913, Soddy and Fajan framed the displacement laws governing the daughter nucleus produced during an alpha and beta decay. They are stated below:</p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li class="block_6">When a radioactive element emits an alpha particle, a daughter nucleus is formed whose mass number is less by 4 units and the atomic number is less by 2 units, than the mass number and atomic number of the parent nucleus.</li>
	<li class="block_8">When a radioactive element emits a beta particle, a daughter nucleus is formed whose mass number is the same and the atomic number is more by 1 unit, than the atomic number of the parent nucleus.</li>

This process of breaking (splitting) up of a heavier nucleus into two smaller nuclei with the release of a large amount of energy and a few neutrons is called 'nuclear fission'.

	<p class="block_">Example: U<span class="calibre28">ranium  235</span>, plutonium (<span class="calibre28">plutonium  </span>239 and P<span class="calibre28">lutonium  </span><span class="calibre28">241) All isotopes of uranium do not undergo nuclear fission when they absorb a neutron.

Of these two, Uranium 238  does not undergo fission whereas Uranium 235  undergoes fission. Hence,  Uranium 235 <sup class="calibre27"> </sup>is a fissionable material and  Uranium 238  is non- fissionable.</p>
	<p class="block_">There are some radioactive elements, which can be converted into fissionable material. They are called as fertile materials. Example : <span class="tab">      </span>Uranium-238, Thorium-232, Plutonium-240.</p>
	<h3 class="block_11" id="toc_id_178">6.3.3 Chain Reaction </h3>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">A uranium nucleus (U-235) when bombarded with a neutron   undergoes fission producing three neutrons.  These three neutrons in turn can cause fission in three other uranium nuclei present in the sample, thus producing nine neutrons. These nine neutrons in turn may produce twenty-seven neutrons and so on. This is known as 'chain reaction'. A chain reaction is a self- propagating process in which the number of neutrons goes on multiplying rapidly almost in a geometrical progression.</span></p>
	<p class="block_">Two kinds of chain reactions are possible. They are: (One) controlled chain reaction and (Two)uncontrolled chain reaction.</p>
	<div class="calibre10">
	<div class="block_14"><span class="bullet_1">(a) </span><span class="calibre52"><b class="calibre6">Controlled chain reaction</b></span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">In the controlled chain reaction, the number of neutrons released is maintained to be one.  This is achieved by absorbing the extra neutrons with a neutron absorber leaving only one neutron to produce further fission. Thus, the reaction is sustained in a controlled manner. The energy released due to a controlled chain reaction can be utilized for constructive purposes. Controlled chain reaction is used in a nuclear reactor to produce energy in a sustained and controlled manner.</span></p>
	<p class="block_12"> (b) Uncontrolled chain reaction</p>
	<p class="block_">In the uncontrolled chain reaction, the number of neutrons multiplies indefinitely and causes fission in a large amount of the fissile material. This results in the release of a huge amount of energy within a fraction of a second. This kind of chain reaction is used in the atom bomb to produce an explosion. Figure 6.3 represents an uncontrolled chain reaction.</p>

	<p class="block_12">Figure 6.3 Uncontrolled chain reaction</p>
	<p class="block_12">6.3.4 Critical Mass</p>
	<p class="block_">During a nuclear fission process, about 2 to 3 neutrons are released. But all these neutrons may not be available to produce further fission. Some of them may escape from the system, which is termed as 'leakage of neutrons' and some may be absorbed by the non-fissionable materials present in the system. These two factors lead to the loss of neutrons. To sustain the chain reaction, the rate of production of neutrons due to nuclear fission must be more than the rate of its loss. This can be achieved only when the size (That is mass) of the fissionable material is equal to a certain optimum value. This is known as 'critical mass'.</p>
	<p class="block_">The minimum mass of a fissile material necessary to sustain the chain reaction is called' critical mass (mc)'. It depends on the nature, density and the size of the fissile material.</p>
	<p class="block_">If the mass of the fissile material is less than the critical mass, it is termed as 'subcritical'. If the mass of the fissile material is more than the critical mass, it is termed as 'supercritical'.</p>

	<p class="block_19">6.3.5 Atom bomb</p>
	<p class="block_9">The atom bomb is based on the principle of uncontrolled chain reaction. In an uncontrolled chain reaction, the number of neutrons and the number of fission reactions multiply almost in a geometrical progression. This releases a huge amount of energy in a very small-time interval and leads to an explosion.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Structure:</p>
	<p class="block_9">An atom bomb consists of a piece of fissile material whose mass is subcritical. This piece has a cylindrical void. It has a cylindrical fissile material which can fit into this void and its mass is also subcritical. When the bomb has to be exploded, this cylinder is injected into the void using a conventional explosive. Now, the two pieces of fissile material join to form the supercritical mass, which leads to an explosion. The structure of an atom bomb is shown in Figure 6.4</p>

	<p class="block_">During this explosion tremendous amount of energy in the form of heat, light and radiation is released. A region of very high temperature and pressure is formed in a fraction of a second along with the emission of hazardous radiation like γ rays, which adversely affect the living creatures. This type of atom bombs was exploded in 1945 at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan during the World War II.</p>

	<p class="block_">You have learnt that energy can be produced when a heavy nucleus is split up into two smaller nuclei. Similarly, energy can be produced when two lighter nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus. This phenomenon is known as nuclear fusion.</p>
	<h3 class="block_11" id="toc_id_180">6.4.1 Definition</h3>
	<p class="block_">The process in which two lighter nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus is termed as 'nuclear fusion'.</p>

	<p class="block_9">'Little boy'. It was a gun-type bomb which used a uranium core. The bomb, which was subsequently dropped over Nagasaki was called as 'Fat man'. It was an explosion type bomb, which used a plutonium core.</p>
	<h3 class="block_11" id="toc_id_181">6.4.2 Conditions necessary for nuclear fusion</h3>
	<p class="block_9">Earth’s atmosphere contains a small trace of hydrogen. If nuclear fusion is a spontaneous process at normal temperature and pressure, then a number of fusion processes would happen in the atmosphere which may lead to explosions. But we do not encounter any such explosions. Can you explain why?</p>
	<p class="block_9">The answer is that nuclear fusion can take place only under certain conditions.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Nuclear fusion is possible only at an extremely high temperature of the order of 10 power of  7 to </p>
	<p class="block_9">10 power of 9 Kelvin  and a high pressure to push the hydrogen nuclei closer to fuse with each other. Hence, it is named as 'Thermonuclear reaction'.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Do you know</p>
	<p class="block_9">Nuclear fusion is the combination of two lighter nuclei. The charge of both nuclei is positive. According to electrostatic theory, when they come closer, they tend to repel each other. This repulsive force will be overcome by the kinetic energy of the nuclei at higher temperature of the order of 10 power of  7 to 10 power of  9 Kelvin.</p>
	<h3 class="block_11" id="toc_id_182">6.4.3 Stellar Energy</h3>
	<p class="block_">The stars like our Sun emit a large amount of energy in the form of light and heat. This energy is termed as the stellar energy. Where does this high energy come from? All stars contain a large amount of hydrogen. The surface temperature of the stars is very high which is sufficient to induce fusion of the hydrogen nuclei.</p>
	<p class="block_">Fusion reaction that takes place in the cores of the Sun and other stars results in an enormous amount of energy, which is called as 'stellar energy. Thus, nuclear fusion or thermonuclear reaction is the source of light and heat energy in the Sun and other stars.</p>

	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">Hydrogen bomb is based on the principle of nuclear fusion. A hydrogen bomb is always designed to have   an inbuilt atom bomb which creates the high temperature and pressure required for fusion when it explodes. Then, fusion takes place in the hydrogen core and leads to the release of a very large amount of energy in an uncontrolled manner. The energy released in a hydrogen bomb (or fusion bomb) is much higher than that released in an atom bomb (or fission bomb).</span></p>

	<p class="block_">You have learnt, in your lower classes that matter is around us everywhere. Matter is made of atoms. Curiously the idea of atom was first proposed by the Greek philosophers in the fifth century BC (BCE). But their theory was more philosophical than scientific.</p>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">The first scientific theory of the atom was proposed by John Dalton. Few of the postulates of Dalton’s theory about an atom were found incorrect by the later on studies made by J.J. Thomson, Rutherford, Neils   Bohr and Schrodinger. In the light of the result of the research most of the limitations of the Dalton’s theory were</span> removed and a new theory known as the modern atomic theory was put forward. ‘The main postulates of modern atomic theory’ are as follows:</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_321">An atom is no longer indivisible (after the discovery of the electron, proton, and neutron).</li>
	<li class="block_322">Atoms of the same element may have different atomic mass. (Discovery of isotopes 17Cl35, 17Cl37).</li>
	<li class="block_322">Atoms of different elements may have same atomic masses (discovery of Isobars 18Ar40, 20Ca40).</li>
	<li class="block_322">Atoms of one element can be transmuted into atoms of other elements. In other words, atom is no longer indestructible (discovery of artificial transmutation).</li>
	<li class="block_322">Atoms may not always combine in a simple whole number ratio (Example Glucose C6H12O6 C is to H is to O = 6 is to 12 is to 6 or 1 is to 2 is to 1 and Sucrose C12H22O11 C is to H is to O = 12 is to 22 is to 11).</li>
	<li class="block_322">Atom is the smallest particle that takes part in a chemical reaction.</li>
	<li class="block_323">The mass of an atom can be converted into energy (E = mc power 2).</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_9">The modern atomic theory is the basis for all the studies of chemical and physical processes that involve atoms. You have studied the most fundamental ideas about an atom in your lower classes. Let us discuss some more concepts about atoms in this lesson.<br class="calibre26"/> </p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_193">7.1 ATOM AND ATOMIC MASS</h2>
	<p class="block_">As you know, anything that has mass and occupies space is called matter. Atoms are the building blocks of matter. Since matter has mass, it must be due to its atoms. According to the modern atomic theory, an atom contains subatomic particles such as protons, neutrons and electrons. Protons and neutrons have considerable mass, but electrons don't have such a considerable mass. Thus, the mass of an atom is mainly contributed by its protons and neutrons and hence the sum of the number of protons and neutrons of an atom is called its mass number.</p>
	<p class="block_">Individual atoms are very small, and it is difficult to measure their masses. You can measure the mass of macroscopic materials in gram or kilogram. The mass of an atom is measured in atomic mass unit (amu).</p>
	<p class="block_">Atomic mass unit is one-twelfth of the mass of a carbon-12 atom; an isotope of carbon, which contains 6 protons and 6 neutrons.</p>
	<p class="block_">(Note: The symbol ‘amu’ is no longer used in the modern system and instead, it uses the symbol ‘u’ to denote unified atomic mass. The mass of a proton or neutron is approximately 1 amu).</p>
	<h3 class="block_11" id="toc_id_194">7.1.1 Relative Atomic Mass (RAM)</h3>
	<p class="block_">As an atom is very small, its absolute mass cannot be determined directly. The early pioneers of chemistry used to measure the atomic mass of an atom relative to an atom of another element. They measured the masses of equal number of atoms of two or more elements at a time, to determine their relative masses. They established one element as a standard, gave it an arbitrary value of atomic mass and using this value they measured the relative mass of other elements. The mass obtained by this way is called relative atomic mass. In the beginning, the mass of hydrogen atom was chosen as a standard and masses of other atoms were compared with it, because of the existence of isotopic character of hydrogen (1H1, 1H2, 1H3). Later hydrogen atom was replaced by oxygen atom as the standard. Now, the stable isotope of carbon (C-12) with atomic mass 12 is used as the standard for measuring the relative atomic mass of an element.</p>
	<p class="block_">Relative atomic mass of an element is the ratio between the average mass of its isotopes to </p>
	<p class="block_">1 by 12 th part of the mass of a carbon-12 atom. It is denoted as Ar. It is otherwise called “Standard Atomic Weight”.</p>

	<p class="block_"> Modern methods of determination of atomic mass by Mass Spectrometry uses C-12 as standard. For most of the elements, the relative atomic mass is very closer to a whole number, and it is rounded off to a whole number, to make calculations easier. Table 7.1 lists some of the elements of periodic table and their Relative Atomic mass values.</p>

	<p class="block_9">How can one measure the atomic mass of an element? It is somewhat more complicated because most of the naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes, each of which has its own mass. Thus, it is essential to consider this isotopic mixture while calculating the atomic mass of an element.</p>
	<p class="block_">The average atomic mass of an element is the weighted average of the masses of its naturally occurring isotopes.</p>
	<p class="block_">But, the abundance of isotopes of each element may differ. So, the abundancy of all these isotopes is taken into consideration while calculating the atomic mass. Then, what do we mean by a weighted average? </p>
	<p class="block_">Let us consider an element which exists as a mixture of 50% of an isotope having a mass of 9 amu, and 50% of another isotope having a mass of 10 amu. Then, its average atomic mass is calculated by the following equation:</p>
	<p class="block_">Average atomic mass</p>
	<p class="block_">= (Mass of 1st isotope × % abundance of 1st isotope) + (Mass of 2nd isotope ×% abundance of 2nd isotope) Thus, for the given element the average</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-91.png" alt="Atomic mass is equal to  9 multiply 50 divided by 100 plus10 multiply 50 divided by 100 is 4.5 plus 5 is 9.5 atomic mass unit" class="calibre154"/></p>
	<p class="block_261"> </p>
	<p class="block_61"> </p>
	<p class="block_">(Note: In the calculations involving percentages, you need to convert percentage abundance into fractional abundance. For example, 50 percent is converted into 50 by 100 or 0.50 as shown in a foresaid calculation.)</p>
	<p class="block_">The atomic masses of elements, given in the periodic table, are average atomic masses. Sometimes, the term atomic weight is used to mean average atomic mass. It is observed, from the periodic table that atomic masses of most of the elements are not whole numbers. For instance, the atomic mass of carbon given in the periodic table is 12.01 amu, not 12.00 amu. The reason is that while calculating the atomic mass of carbon, both of its natural isotopes such as carbon-12. and carbon-13 are considered. The natural abundance of C-12 and C-13 are 98.90 % and 1.10 % respectively. The average of the atomic mass of carbon is calculated as follows:</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-92.png" alt="Average atomic mass of carbon is 12 multiply 98.9 divided by 100 plus 13 multiply 1.1 divided by 100 is  12 multiply 0.989 plus 13 multiply 0.011 is 11.868 plus 0.143 is 12.011 atomic mass unit" class="calibre155"/></p>
	<p class="block_2"> </p>
	<p class="block_261"> </p>
	<p class="block_">So, it is important to understand that if it is mentioned that the atomic mass of carbon is 12 amu, it refers to the average atomic mass of the carbon isotopes, not the mass of the individual atoms of carbon.</p>

	<p class="block_">As the molecules are made of atoms, they also have their own mass. The mass of the molecule of an element or compound is measured in the C-12 scale and hence called relative molecular mass. The Relative Molecular Mass of a molecule is the ratio between the mass of one molecule of the substance to 1 by 12 th mass of an atom of Carbon 12</p>
	<p class="block_12">Do you Know</p>
	<p class="block_419">Relative Molecular Mass is only a ratio. So, it has no unit. If the molecular mass of a compound is expressed in grams, it is called Gram Molecular Mass.</p>
	<p class="block_420">Gram Molecular Mass of water =18gram</p>
	<p class="block_420">Gram Molecular Mass of carbon dioxide = 44gram</p>

	<p class="block_422">Calculation of relative molecular mass – Solved examples:</p>
	<p class="block_422"><b class="calibre36">Example 1:</b> Relative molecular mass of sulphuric acid (H2SO4) is calculated as follows: Sulphuric acid contains 2 atoms of hydrogen, 1 atom of sulphur and 4 atoms of oxygen.</p>

	<p class="block_422">= (2 × 1) + (1 × 32) + (4 × 16)</p>
	<p class="block_422">= 98</p>
	<p class="block_422">That is one molecule of H2SO4 is 98 times as heavy as 1 by 12 the of the mass of a carbon 12.</p>

	<p class="block_422">So, the relative molecular mass of water</p>
	<p class="block_422">= (2 × mass of hydrogen) + (1 × mass of oxygen)</p>
	<p class="block_422">= (2 × 1) + (1 × 16)</p>

	<p class="block_422">So far, we discussed about matters in terms of individual atoms and molecules. Atomic mass units provide a relative scale for the masses of the elements. Since the atoms have such small masses, no usable scale can be devised to weigh them in the calibrated units of atomic mass units. In any real situation, we deal with macroscopic samples containing enormous number of atoms. Therefore, it is convenient to have a special unit to describe a very large number of atoms. The idea of a ‘unit’ to denote a particular number of objects is not new. For example, the pair (2 items) and the dozen (12 items), are all familiar units. Chemists measure atoms and molecules in moles. So, you can now understand that ‘mole’ denotes a number of particles.</p>
	<p class="block_419">In the SI system, the mole (mol) is the amount of a substance that contains as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, or other particles) as there are atoms in exactly 12 gram (or 0.012 kg) of the carbon 12 isotope. The actual number of atoms in 12 gram of carbon 12 is determined experimentally. This is called</p>
	<p class="block_419">Avogadro’s Number (NA), named after an Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro who proposed its significance. Its value is 6.023 × 10 power 23. So, one mole of a substance contains 6.023 × 10 power 23 entities. Thus, 5 moles of oxygen molecules contain 5 × 6.023 ×10 power 23 molecules.</p>
	<p class="block_419">Mole Concept: The study of the collection of particles by using mole as the counting unit, in order to express the mass and volume of such unit particles in a bulk of matter is known as mole concept.</p>
	<p class="block_419">The number of moles of a substance can be calculated by various means depending on the data available, as follows:</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_437">Number of moles of molecules.</li>
	<li class="block_438">Number of moles of atoms.</li>

	<p class="block_">So, for, we were dealing with the number of entities present in a given substance. But many times, the information regarding the percentage of a particular element present in a compound is required.</p>
	<p class="block_">The percentage composition of a compound represents the mass of each element present in 100 gram of the compound.</p>
	<p class="block_">Let us understand the percentage composition of oxygen and hydrogen by taking the example of H2O. It can be calculated using the formula</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-96.png" alt="Mass percentage of an element is mass of that element in the compound divided by molecular mass of the compound multiply by 100. Now molecular mass of water is 2 plus 16 = 18 gram. Mass percentage of Hydrogen is 2 divided by 18 multiply by 100 is 11.11 percentage. Mass of Oxygen is 16 divided by 18 multiply by 100 is 88.89 percentage." class="calibre161"/></p>
	<p class="block_9">This percentage composition is useful to determine the empirical formula and molecular formula.</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_221">7.6 AVOGADRO HYPOTHESIS</h2>
	<p class="block_">In 1811 Avogadro framed a hypothesis based on the relationship between the number of molecules present in equal volumes of gases in different conditions.</p>
	<p class="block_">The Avogadro’s law states that “equal volumes of all gases under similar conditions of temperature and pressure contain equal number of molecules”</p>
	<p class="block_">It follows that the volume of any given gas must be proportional to the number of molecules in it. If ‘V’ is the volume and ‘n’ is the number of molecules of a gas, then Avogadro law is represented, mathematically, as follows:</p>
	<p class="block_442">V<span class="calibre15">  is directly proportional to  </span> n</p>
	<p class="block_443"><span class="text_29">V equal to constant </span>multiply by  n</p>
	<p class="block_">Thus, one litre (1 dm power 3) of hydrogen contains the same number of molecules as in one litre of oxygen,  that is , the volume of the gas is directly proportional to the number of molecules of the gas.</p>

	<p class="block_9">According to Avogadro’s law 1 volume of any gas is occupied by “n” number of molecules. </p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_229">INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p class="block_">The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries witnessed a rapid development in chemistry in all spheres of scientific activities. By 1860, scientists had already discovered 60 elements and determined their atomic masses. They noticed that some elements had similar properties and hence arranged them into groups. During this period, several new elements were discovered. These elements were found to have different properties. It was realized that instead of studying the properties of all these elements individually, it would be more convenient to divide them into groups and periods in such a way that each group contained a certain number of elements (like an array of fruits and vegetables showing orderliness) with similar properties and periods showing a regular gradation. So, scientists made several attempts to arrange elements in a logical way. You have studied about all these early attempts of arrangement of elements in standard IX. In continuation of the knowledge gained in the topic periodic classification of elements in standard IX with earlier concepts and their subsequent deliberations, you get set to go ahead with the higher order of thinking to enhance your knowledge on the properties of elements.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_230">8.1 MODERN PERIODIC LAW</h2>
	<p class="block_9">Mendeleev’s periodic table had some discrepancies, which were difficult to overcome. For example, the atomic mass of argon (39.95 amu) is greater than that of potassium (39.10 amu), but argon comes before potassium in the periodic table. If elements were arranged solely according to increasing atomic mass, argon would appear in the position occupied by potassium in our modern periodic table (see in Figure 8.1). No chemist would place argon, a gas with no tendency to react, in the same group as lithium and sodium, which are two highly reactive metals. This kind of discrepancies suggested that some fundamental property other than atomic mass must be the basis of periodicity. The fundamental property turned out to be the number of protons in an atom’s nucleus, something that could not have been known by Mendeleev and his contemporaries.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Henry Moseley, a British scientist in 1912, discovered a new property of elements called atomic number, which provided a better basis for the periodic arrangement of the elements. It is a well-known fact that atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons or the number of electrons present in the neutral atom of an element. The periodic law was, therefore, modified to frame a modern periodic law, which states that</p>
	<p class="block_9">“The physical and chemical properties of the elements are the periodic functions of</p>
	<p class="block_9">their atomic numbers”.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_231">8.2 MODERN PERIODIC TABLE</h2>
	<p class="block_">With reference to the modern periodic law, the elements were arranged in the increasing order of their atomic numbers to form the modern periodic table. The modern periodic table is a tabular arrangement of elements in rows and columns, highlighting the regular repetition of properties of the elements. Figure 8.1 shows the modern periodic table of 118 elements discovered so far.</p>
	<p class="block_">As you have studied the features of the modern periodic table in standard IX, here let us confine to the study of the features of periods and groups.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Features of Periods</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_6">The horizontal rows are called periods. There are seven periods in the periodic table.</li>
	<li class="block_7">First period (Atomic number 1 and 2): This is the shortest period. It contains only two elements (Hydrogen and Helium).</li>
	<li class="block_7">Second period (Atomic number 3 to 10): This is a short period. It contains eight elements (Lithium to Neon).</li>
	<li class="block_7">Third period (Atomic number 11 to 18): This is also a short period. It contains eight elements (Sodium to Argon).</li>
	<li class="block_7">Fourth period (Atomic number 19 to 36): This is a long period. It contains eighteen elements (Potassium to Krypton). This includes 8 representative elements and 10 transition elements.</li>
	<li class="block_7">Fifth period (Atomic number 37 to 54): This is also a long period. It contains 18 elements (Rubidium to Xenon). This includes 8 representative elements and 10 transition elements.</li>
	<li class="block_7">Sixth period (Atomic number 55 to 86): This is the longest period. It contains 32 elements (Caesium to Radon). This includes 8 representative elements, 10 transition elements and 14 inner transition elements (Lanthanides).</li>
	<li class="block_8">Seventh period (Atomic number 87 to 118): Like the sixth period, this period also accommodates 32 elements. Recently 4 elements have been included by IUPAC.</li>

	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-120.png" alt="A QR code is given with a code of SCFYQ" class="calibre191"/></p>
	<p class="block_9">The electronic configurations of elements help us to explain the periodic recurrence of physical and chemical properties. Anything which repeats itself after a regular interval is called periodic and this behaviour is called periodicity. Some of the atomic properties of the elements are periodic.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Properties such as atomic radius, ionic radius, ionisation energy, electronegativity, electron affinity, show a regular periodicity and hence they are called periodic properties. The main significance of the modern periodic table is that it gives a clear understanding of the general properties and trends within a group or a period to predict with considerable accuracy, the properties of any element, even though that element may be unfamiliar to us. Let us discuss the periodic trend of some of the properties.</p>
	<p class="block_19">8.3.1 Atomic Radius</p>
	<p class="block_9">Atomic radius of an atom is defined as the distance between the centre of its nucleus and the outermost shell containing the valence electron. Direct measurement of the radius of an isolated atom is not possible. Except for noble gases, usually the atomic radius is referred to as covalent radius or metallic radius depending on the nature of the</p>
	<p class="block_9"><img src="images/image-121.png" alt="figure 8.2 (A)Metallic Radius figure 8.2 (b)Covalent Radius are shown.  " class="calibre192"/></p>
	<p class="block_589">Figure 8.2</p>
	<p class="block_589">(a)Metallic Radius</p>
	<p class="block_589">(b)Covalent Radius</p>
	<p class="block_9">bonding between the concerned atoms. Atomic radius in metal atoms is known as metallic radius. It is defined as half the distance between the nuclei of adjacent metal atoms (Figure 8.2a)). </p>
	<p class="block_9">In non-metallic elements, their atomic radius is known as Covalent radius. It is defined as half the distance between the nuclei of two covalently bonded atoms of the same element in a molecule (Figure 8.2 (b)). For example, let us consider H2 molecule. The distance between the two hydrogen nuclei of the molecule is 0.74 Angstrom. So its covalent radius is 0.74 by 2 = 0.37 Angstrom. </p>
	<p class="block_9">When you look at the variation of the atomic radii in the periodic table, there are two distinct trends. Along the period, from left to right, the atomic radius of the elements decreases whereas along the groups, from the top to bottom, the atomic radius increases.<img src="images/image-122.png" alt="figure 8.3 Atomic radius of hydrogen is shown." class="calibre193"/></p>
	<p class="block_12">Figure 8.3 Atomic radius</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image138.jpeg" alt="figure 8.4 variation of atomic radiation is shown  with the help of boron atom which has five electrons. " class="calibre194"/></p>
	<p class="block_">The increase, down a group, is due to the increase in the valence shell number down the group. As the shell number increases, the distance between the valence shell and the nucleus increases. In contrast, when you observe along the period, the shell number remains the same but the number of protons (i.e. atomic number) increases. More and more positive charges impose a strong attraction over the electrons and thus the electron cloud shrinks towards the nucleus, which results in the decrease in the atomic size. Figure 8.4 shows how the atomic radius decreases from lithium to boron.</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image137.jpeg" alt="figure 8.4 variation of atomic radiation is shown  with the help of lithium atom which has three electrons. " class="calibre195"/></p>
	<p class="block_12">Figure 8.4 Variation of atomic radius</p>
	<p class="block_12"><span class="calibre28">8.3.2   Ionic Radii</span></p>
	<p class="block_">It is defined as the distance from the centre of the nucleus of the ion up to the point where it exerts its influence on the electron cloud of the ion.</p>
	<p class="block_74"><img src="images/image-123.png" alt="figure 8.5 Relative ionic radii of cation and anion  table. radii of lithium atom is 156 picometer radii of lithium anion 90 picometer. radii of sodium atom is 186 picometer radii of sodium anion is 116 picometer. radii of fluorine atom is 69 picometer radii of fluorine cation is 119 picometer. radii of chlorine atom is 91 picometer radii of chlorine cation is 167 picometer.   " class="calibre196"/></p>
	<p class="block_138">Figure 8.5 Relative ionic radii of cation and anion</p>
	<p class="block_9">You know that ions are formed when an atom loss or gain electrons. When a neutral atom loses an electron, it becomes a positively charged ion called cation, whereas the gain of an electron by a neutral atom forms a negatively charged ion called anion. The size of the ions is important to determine their behaviours in solutions and the structure of ionic solids. The size of a cation is always smaller than its corresponding neutral atom. But the anion is larger than its neutral atom.</p>
	<p class="block_9">For instance, lithium and sodium lose the single electron from their outermost energy level to form cations. The ions so formed are smaller because the remaining electrons are at inner cells and attracted more strongly by the nucleus. Fluorine and chlorine become negative ions by gaining an electron. When electrons are added, the charge on the nucleus is not great enough to hold the increased number of electrons as closely as it holds the electrons in the neutral atom. So, as seen in atomic radius, ionic radii also decrease along the period from left to right and increase down the group.</p>
	<p class="block_12">8.3.3 Ionisation Energy</p>
	<p class="block_">Ionisation energy is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from an isolated gaseous atom in its ground state to form a cation. It is otherwise called ionisation enthalpy. It is measured in kJ per mol. Higher the ionisation energy; it is more difficult to remove the electron.</p>
	<p class="block_">As the atomic size decreases from left to right in a period, more energy is required to remove the electrons. So, the ionisation energy increases along the period. But, down the group, the atomic size increases and hence the valence electrons are loosely bound. They require relatively less energy for the removal. Thus, ionisation energy decreases down the group in the periodic table.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Note:</b> As the positive charge increases the size of the cation decreases as the negative charge increases the size of the anion increases</p>
	<p class="block_19">8.3.4 Electron Affinity</p>
	<p class="block_9">Electron affinity is the amount of energy released when an isolated gaseous atom gains an electron to form its anion. It is also measured in kJ per mol and represented by the following equation:</p>
	<p class="block_590">A<span class="text_11">(g) </span>+ electron gives A<span class="text_11">(g) negative ion </span>+ Energy</p>
	<p class="block_590">Cl<span class="text_11">(g)</span>+electron gives C l negative ion gaseous state +energy</p>
	<p class="block_9">Like ionisation energy, electron affinity also increases from left to right in a period and decreases from top to bottom in a group.</p>
	<p class="block_19">More to Know</p>
	<p class="block_9">Noble gases show no tendency to accept electrons because the outer s and p orbitals of noble gases are completely filled. No more electrons can be added to them and hence their electron affinities are zero.</p>
	<p class="block_12">8.3.5 Electronegativity</p>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">Electronegativity of an element is the measure of the tendency of its atom to attract the shared pair of electrons towards itself in a covalent bond. Let us consider HCl molecule. Both the hydrogen and chlorine atoms share one electron each to form the covalent bond between them. chlorine atom has a  higher electronegativity and hence it pulls the shared electrons towards itself more strongly than hydrogen. Thus, when the bond breaks, the bonding electrons are left with chlorine forming H</span> positive ion and C l negative ions. It is represented, diagrammatically, as shown below:</p>
	<p class="block_74"><img src="images/image-124.png" alt="Relative electronegativity of H and Cl  diagram. hydrogen has weak pull for electron. so hydrogen losses electron and become positive ion. chlorine has strong pull for electron so chlorine gain electron and become negative ion. thus electron transferred from hydrogen to chlorine.  " class="calibre197"/></p>
	<p class="block_138">Figure 8.6 Relative electronegativity of H and Cl</p>
	<p class="block_9">Electronegativity is based on various experimental data such as bond energy, ionization potential, electron affinity, etc. Pauling scale is the widely used scale to determine the electronegativity, which in turn predicts the nature of bonding (ionic or covalent) between the atoms in a molecule. Electronegativity of some of the elements are given below</p>
	<p class="block_9">F = 4.0, Cl = 3.0, Br = 2.8, I = 2.5, H = 2.1, Na = 1</p>
	<p class="block_9"><span class="calibre15">If the difference in electronegativity between two elements   is   1.7,   the   bond has 50% ionic character and 50% covalent character.</span></p>
	<p class="block_9">If the difference is less than 1.7, the bond is considered to be covalent.</p>
	<p class="block_9">If the difference is greater than 1.7, the bond is considered to be more ionic.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Along the period, from left to right in the periodic table, the electronegativity increases because of the increase in the nuclear charge which in turn attracts the electrons more strongly. On moving down a group, the electronegativity of the elements decreases because of the increased number of valence shells.</p>

	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-125.png" alt="A QR code is given with a code of 6 A S F X" class="calibre198"/></p>
	<p class="block_9">Human life is associated with various metals. We use metals in our day-to-day activities. It is the utmost need to have some metals like sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, etc. in the human body. Deficiency of these metals affects the metabolic activities thereby causing diseases. So, metals play a vital role in our life. In this section, let us discuss how metals are obtained from various sources by the process of metallurgy.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Metallurgy is a science of extracting metals from their ores and modifying the metals into alloys for various uses, based on their physical and chemical properties and their structural arrangement of atoms. A metallurgical process involve three main steps as follows:</p>
	<p class="block_23">(i) <span class="calibre15">Concentration or Separation of the ore:   It is the process of removal of impurities from the ore.</span></p>
	<p class="block_23">(ii) <span class="calibre15">Production of the metal:   It is the conversion of the ore into metal.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_23"><span class="calibre15">(iii) Refining of the metal:   It is the process of purification of the metal.</span></p>
	<h3 class="block_11" id="toc_id_234">8.4.1 Terminology in metallurgy</h3>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">Minerals:   A mineral may be a single compound or a complex mixture of various compounds of metals found in the Earth.</span></p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Ore: th</b><span class="calibre28">e mineral from which a metal can be readily and economically extracted on a large scale is said to be an ore.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-126.png" alt="All ores are minerals; But all minerals are not ores. Why?" class="calibre199"/></p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">For example</b>: Clay (A l2 O3. 2 Si O2. 2 H2 O) and bauxite (A l2 O3.2 H2 O) are the two minerals of aluminium, but aluminium can be profitably extracted only from bauxite. Hence, bauxite is an ore of aluminium and clay is its mineral.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Mining</b>: The process of extracting the ores from the Earth's crust is called mining.</p>
	<p class="block_">Gangue or Matrix: The rocky impurity associated with an ore is called gangue or matrix.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Flux:</b> It is the substance added to the ore to reduce the fusion temperature and to remove the impurities. E.g., Calcium oxide (basic), Silica (acidic). If the gangue is acidic, then basic flux is added and vice versa.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Slag:</b> It is the fusible product formed when a flux reacts with a gangue during the extraction of metals.</p>
	<p class="block_606"><span class="tab1">      </span><span class="tab1">      </span>Flux + Gangue gives Slag</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6"> Smelting:</b> Smelting is the process of reducing the roasted metallic oxide from the metal in its molten condition. In this process, impurities are removed as slag by the addition of flux.</p>
	<p class="block_12">8.4.2 Types of separation or concentration of an ore</p>
	<p class="block_">There are four major types of separation of ores based on the nature of the ore. The different kinds of ores of metals are given in Table 8.1</p>
	<p class="block_12">Concentration of the crushed ore is done mainly by the following methods: -</p>
	<p class="block_12">(i)Hydraulic (Gravity Separation) method</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Principle:</b> The difference in the densities or specific gravities of the ore and the gangue is the main principle behind this method. Oxide ores are purified by this method. example Haematite F e2 O3 the ore of iron.</p>
	<p class="block_">Note: When the ore is heavier than the impurity, this method can be used.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Method:</b> The ore is poured over a sloping, vibrating corrugated table with grooves and a jet of water is allowed to flow over it. The denser ore particles settle down in the grooves and lighter gangue particles are washed down by water.</p>
	<p class="block_12">(ii) Magnetic separation method</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Principle:</b> The magnetic properties of the ores form the basis of separation. When either the ore or the gangue is magnetic, this method is employed. e.g., Tinstone S n O2, the ore of tin.</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-127.png" alt="Magnetic separation explanation diagram is given" class="calibre200"/></p>
	<p class="block_12">Figure 8.8 Magnetic separation</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Method:</b> The crushed ore is placed over a conveyer belt which rotates around two metal wheels, one of which is magnetic. The magnetic particles are attracted to the magnetic wheel and fall separately apart from the non- magnetic particles.</p>
	<p class="block_12">(iii)<span class="tab">      </span>Froth floatation</p>
	<p class="block_">Principle: This process depends on the preferential wettability of the ore with oil (pine oil) and the gangue particles by water. Lighter ores, such as sulphide ores, are concentrated by this method. </p>
	<p class="block_">e.g., Zinc blende (Z n S).</p>

	<p class="block_12">Figure 8.9 Froth floatation</p>
	<p class="block_">Note: When the impurity is heavier than the ore this method can be used.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Method:</b> The crushed ore is taken in a large tank containing pine oil and water and agitated with a current of compressed air. The ore is wetted by the oil and gets separated from the gangue in the form of froth. Since the ore is lighter, it comes on the surface with the froth and the impurities are left behind. e.g., Zinc blende (ZnS).</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_250">INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p class="block_">You have learnt about mixtures in your lower classes. Most of the substances that we encounter in our daily life are mixtures of two or more substances. The substances present in a mixture may exist in one or more physical state. For example, when we burn wood, the smoke released is a mixture of solid carbon and gases like C O2, C O, etc.</p>
	<p class="block_">In some cases of mixtures, their components can be separated easily whereas in some other cases they cannot be. Consider the two mixtures, one which contains salt and water, and the another which contains sand and water. Water is the one of the components in both the mixtures. In the first case salt dissolves in water. In the second case the sand does not dissolve in water. Sand in water can be separated by filtration but salt cannot be separated as it dissolves in water to form a homogeneous mixture. This kind of homogenous mixtures are termed as “solutions”.</p>
	<p class="block_74"><img src="images/image-135.png" alt="SALT + WATER AND SAND =WATER IMAGE SHOWS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  Homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures" class="calibre210"/></p>
	<p class="block_138">Figure 9.1 Homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_251">9.1 SOLUTIONS IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE</h2>
	<p class="block_9">One of the naturally existing solutions is sea water. We cannot imagine life on earth without sea water. It is a mixture of many dissolved salts. Another one is air. It is a mixture of gases like nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and other gases.</p>
	<p class="block_9">All the life forms on the earth are associated with solutions. Plants take solutions of nutrients for their growth from the soil. Most of the liquids found in human body including blood, lymph and urine are solutions. Day to day human activities like washing, cooking, cleaning and few other activities involve the formation of solutions with water. Similarly, the drinks what we take, like fruit juice, aerated drinks, tea, coffee etc. are also solutions. Therefore, the ability of water to form solutions is responsible for sustenance of life </p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_252">9.2 COMPONENTS OF SOLUTIONS</h2>
	<p class="block_">We know that, a solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. In a solution, the component which is present in lesser amount (by weight), is called solute and the component, which is present in a larger amount (by weight) is called solvent. The solute gets distributed uniformly throughout the solvent and thus forming the mixture homogeneous. So, the solvent acts as a dissolving medium in a solution. The process of uniform distribution of solute into solvent is called dissolution. Figure 9.2 shows the schematic representation of solution.</p>

	<p class="block_9">A solution must at least be consisting of two components (a solute and a solvent). Such solutions which are made of one solute and one solvent (two components) are called binary solutions. e.g. On adding copper sulphate crystals to water, it dissolves in water forming a solution of copper sulphate as shown in Figure 9.3. It contains two components i.e. one solute- copper sulphate and one solvent-water So it is a binary solution. Similarly, a solution may contain more than two components. For example if salt and sugar are added to water, both dissolve in water forming a solution. Here two solutes are dissolved in one solvent. Such kind of solutions which contain three components are called ternary solutions.</p>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_254">9.3.1 Based on the physical state of the solute and the solvent</h3>
	<p class="block_">We know that substances normally exist in three physical states (phases) i.e., solid, liquid and gas. In binary solutions, both the solvent and solute may exist in any of these physical states. But the solvent constitutes the major part of the solution. Its physical state is the primary factor which determine the characteristics of the solution. Therefore, there are different types of binary solutions as listed in Table 9.1.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Table9.1Types of binary solutions</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-138.png" alt="Table9.1Types of binary solutions" class="calibre213"/></p>
	<h3 class="block_11" id="toc_id_255">9.3.2 Based on the type of solvent</h3>
	<p class="block_">Most of the substances are soluble in water. That is why, water is called as ‘Universal solvent”. However some substances do not dissolve in water. Therefore, other solvents such as ethers, benzene, alcohols etc., are used to prepare a solution. On the basis of type of solvent, solutions are classified into two types. They are aqueous solutions and non-aqueous solutions.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">a) Aqueous solution</b>:</p>
	<p class="block_">The solution in which water acts as a solvent is called aqueous solution. Example Common salt in water, Sugar in water, Copper sulphate in water etcetera.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">b) Non–Aqueous solution</b>:</p>
	<p class="block_">The solution in which any liquid, other than water, acts as a solvent is called nonaqueous solution. Solvent other than water is referred to as non-aqueous solvent. Generally, alcohols, benzene, ethers, carbon disulphide, acetone, etcetera  are used as non-aqueous solvents. Examples for non-aqueous solutions: Sulphur dissolved in carbon disulphide; Iodine dissolved in carbon tetrachloride.</p>

	<p class="block_18"> </p>
	<h3 class="block_11" id="toc_id_256">9.3.3 Based on the amount of solute</h3>
	<p class="block_9">The amount of the solute that can be dissolved in the given amount of solvent is limited under any given conditions. Based on the amount of solute, in the given amount of solvent, solutions are classified into the following types:</p>
	<p class="block_9">(i) Saturated solution</p>
	<p class="block_9">(ii) Unsaturated solution</p>
	<p class="block_9">(iii) Supersaturated solution</p>
	<p class="block_9"><b class="calibre36">(i) Saturated solution:</b> A solution in which no more solute can be dissolved in a definite amount of the solvent at a given temperature is called saturated solution. Example  36 gram of sodium chloride in 100 gram of water at 25 degree Celcius forms saturated solution. Further addition of sodium chloride, leave it undissolved.</p>
	<p class="block_9"><b class="calibre36">(ii) Unsaturated solution</b>: Unsaturated solution is one that contains less solute than that of the saturated solution at a given temperature. Example 10 gram or 20 gram or 30 gram of Sodium chloride in 100 gram of water at 25 degree Celcius forms an unsaturated solution.</p>
	<p class="block_9"><b class="calibre36">(iii) Super saturated solution:</b> Supersaturated solution is one that contains more solute than the saturated solution at a given temperature. Example  40 gram of sodium chloride in 100 gram of water at 25 degree Celcius forms super saturated solution. This state can be achieved by altering any other conditions like temperature, pressure. Super saturated solutions are unstable, and the solute is reappearing as crystals when the solution is disturbed.</p>
	<p class="block_9"><img src="images/image-139.png" alt="Conceptual thoughts: You are given two samples if solutions of Nacl. Can you identify which one is saturated? and How?" class="calibre215"/></p>
	<h3 class="block_11" id="toc_id_257">9.3.4 Concentrated and dilute solutions</h3>
	<p class="block_9"><span class="calibre15">It is another kind of classification of unsaturated solutions. It expresses the relative concentration of two solutions with respect to their solutes present in the given amount of the solvent. For example, you are given two cups of tea. When you taste them, you feel that one is sweeter than the other. What do you infer from it? The tea which sweet more contains higher amount of sugar than the other. How can you express your observation? You can say that the tea is stronger. But a chemist would say that it is ‘concentrated’. When we compare two  solutions having same solute and solvent  the one which contains higher amount of solute per the given amount of solvent is said to be ‘concentrated </span>solution’ and the another is said to be ‘dilute solution’. They are schematically represented by Figure9.5.</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-140.png" alt="Dilute and Concentrated Solution image given " class="calibre216"/></p>
	<p class="block_">Figure9.5 Dilute and Concentrated Solution</p>
	<p class="block_">Differentiating solutions as dilute and concentrated is a qualitative representation. It does not imply the quantity of the solute. This difference is observed by means of some physical characteristics such as colour, density, etcetera.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Activity 1</p>
	<p class="block_">Look at the following pictures. Label them as dilute and concentrated solution and justify your answer.</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-141.png" alt="Tea and Copper sulphate image are given" class="calibre217"/></p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_258">9.4 Solubility</h2>
	<p class="block_">Usually, there is a limit to the amount of solute that can be dissolved in a given amount of solvent at a given temperature. When this limit is reached, we have a saturated solution and any excess solute that is added, simply resides at the bottom of the solution. The extent of dissolution of a solute in a solvent can be better explained by its solubility. Solubility is a measure of how much of a solute can be dissolved in a specified amount of a solvent.</p>
	<p class="block_"> Solubility is defined as the number of grams of a solute that can be dissolved in 100 gram of a solvent to form its saturated solution at a given temperature and pressure. For example, 36 gram of sodium chloride need to be dissolved in 100 gram of water to form its saturated solution at 25 degree Celcius Thus the solubility of sodium chloride in water is 36 gram at 25 degree Celcius .The solubility is mathematically expressed as</p>
	<p class="block_">Solubility = mass of the solute multiplied by 100 divided by mass of the solvent. </p>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_261">9.4.1Factors affecting solubility</h3>
	<p class="block_">There are three main factors which govern the solubility of a solute. They are:</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-134.png" alt="A QR code is given with a code of X L U 5 P" class="calibre209"/></p>
	<p class="block_">(i) Nature of the solute and solvent</p>
	<p class="block_">(ii) Temperature</p>
	<p class="block_">(iii) Pressure</p>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">(i)  Nature of the solute and solvent</span></p>
	<p class="block_">The nature of the solute and solvent plays an important role in solubility. Although water dissolves an enormous variety of substances, both ionic and covalent, it does not dissolve everything. The phrase that scientists often use when predicting solubility is “like dissolves like.” This expression means that dissolving occurs when similarities exist between the solvent and the solute. For example: Common salt is a polar compound and dissolves readily in polar solvent like water. Non-polar compounds are soluble in non-polar solvents. For example, Fat dissolved in ether. But non-polar compounds, do not dissolve in polar solvents; polar compounds do not dissolve in non-polar solvents.</p>
	<p class="block_">ii. Effect of Temperature</p>
	<p class="block_">Solubility of Solids in Liquid: Generally, solubility of a solid solute in a liquid solvent increase with increase in temperature. For example, a greater amount of sugar will dissolve in warm water than in cold water. In endothermic process, solubility increases with increase in temperature. In exothermic process, solubility decreases with increase in temperature.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Solubility of Gases in liquid Do you know why is it bubbling when water is boiled? Solubility of gases in liquid decrease with increase in temperature. Generally, water contains dissolved oxygen. When water is boiled, the solubility of oxygen in water decreases, so oxygen escapes in the form of bubbles. Aquatic animals live more in cold regions because, more amount of dissolved oxygen is present in the water of cold regions. This shows that the solubility of oxygen in water is more at low temperatures.</p>
	<p class="block_">Effect of Pressure</p>
	<p class="block_">Effect of pressure is observed only in the case of solubility of a gas in a liquid. When the pressure is increased, the solubility of a gas in liquid increases. The common examples for solubility of gases in liquids are carbonated beverages,  That is soft drinks, household cleaners containing aqueous solution of ammonia, formalin-aqueous solution of formaldehyde, etcetera.</p>
	<p class="block_74"><img src="images/image344.jpeg" alt="Effect of pressure on solubility EXPLAINED" class="calibre218"/><img src="images/image345.jpeg" alt="Effect of pressure on solubility " class="calibre219"/></p>
	<p class="block_74">Figure9.6 Effect of pressure on solubility</p>
	<p class="block_19">More to know</p>
	<p class="block_9">The effect of pressure on the solubility of a gas in liquid is given by Henry’s law. It states that, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas over the solution at a definite temperature.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_262">9.5 Concentration of a Solution</h2>
	<p class="block_23">So far, we discussed what is a solution? what does it consist of and its types. Most of the chemical reactions take place in solutions form So it is essential to quantify the solute in solvent to study the reactions. To quantify the solute in a solution, we can use the term</p>
	<p class="block_9">“concentration”.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Concentration of a solution may be defined as the amount of solute present in a given amount of solution or solvent.</p>
	<p class="block_">Quantitatively, concentration of a solution may be expressed in different methods. But here, we shall discuss percentage by mass ( percentage of  mass) and percentage by volume (percentage of  volume).</p>
	<h3 class="block_11" id="toc_id_263">9.5.1 Mass percentage</h3>
	<p class="block_9">Mass percentage of a solution is defined as the percentage by mass of the solute present in the solution. It is mostly used when solute is solid and solvent is liquid.</p>
	<p id="id_Hlk168308285" class="block_9">Mass percentage = mass of the solute x 100 divided by mass of the solution.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Mass percentage = mass of the solute x 100 divided by open bracket mass of the solute + mass of the solvent close bracket.</p>
	<p class="block_18"> </p>
	<p class="block_9">For example: 5% sugar solution (by mass) means 5 gram of sugar in 95 gram of water. Hence it is made of 100gram of solution.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Usually, mass percentage is expressed as w/w (weight / weight); mass percentage is independent of temperature.</p>
	<p class="block_154"> </p>
	<h3 class="block_11" id="toc_id_264">9.5.2 Volume percentage</h3>
	<p class="block_9">Volume percentage is defined as the percentage by volume of solute (in ml) present in the given volume of the solution.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Volume percentage = Volume of the solute x 100 divided by Volume of the solution.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Volume percentage = Volume of the solute x 100 divided by open bracket Volume of the solute + Volume of the solvent close bracket.</p>
	<p class="block_">For example, 10% by volume of the solution of ethanol in water, means 10 ml of ethanol in100 ml of solution (or 90 ml of water)</p>
	<p class="block_">Usually volume percentage is expressed as v divided by v (volume by volume). It is used when both the solute and solvent are liquids. Volume percentage decreases with increases in temperature, because of expansion of liquid.</p>
	<p class="block_">You can notice that in the commercial products that we come across in our dailylife such as a solution of syrups, mouth wash,antiseptic solution, household disinfectants etc.,the concentration of the ingredients is expressed as v by v. Similarly, in ointments, antacid, soaps,etc., the concentration of solutions are expressed as w by w.</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_265">9.6 Hydrated salts and Water of Crystallization</h2>
	<p class="block_">When ionic substances are dissolved in water to make their saturated aqueous solution, their ions attract water molecules which then attached chemically in certain ratio. This process is called hydration. These ionic substances crystallize out from their saturated aqueous solution with a definite number of molecules of water. The numberof water molecules found in the crystalline substance is called water of crystallization.Such salts are called hydrated salts.</p>
	<p class="block_">On heating these hydrated crystalline salts, they lose their water of crystallization and become amorphous or lose their colour(if they are coloured). Table 9.3 shows some common hydrated salts:</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_281">INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p class="block_">As you know from your earlier studies, a chemical reaction involves breaking of old chemical bonds and formation of new chemical bonds. This change may happen spontaneously or it may be facilitated by external forces or energy. Chemistry is all about chemical reactions. In your day-to-day life, you could observe many chemical reactions. A clear understanding of these reactions is essential in order to manipulate them for the sake of human life and environment. So, chemistry mainly focuses on chemical reactions. Let us try to find the answer for the following questions:</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_6">You need energy to play, walk, run or to perform various physical activities. Where do you get the energy from?</li>
	<li class="block_7">How do plants grow and get their food?</li>
	<li class="block_7">How does a car move use fuel?</li>
	<li class="block_8">Why does iron rust on its exposure to water or air?</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_">You get energy from the digestion of the food you eat. Plants grow by absorbing nutrients from the Earth and get their food by photosynthesis. The combustion of a fuel makes the car to move. Oxidation of iron causes rusting. So, all these processes are chemical changes. the materials, which undergo changes are converted into some other new materials. For example, by burning petrol, the hydrocarbons present in it are converted into carbon dioxide and water. In this chapter, let us discuss the nature and types of chemical reactions.</p>
	<p class="block_12">What happens during a chemical reaction?</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_228">In a chemical reaction, the atoms of the reacting molecules or elements are rearranged to form new molecules.</li>
	<li class="block_758">Old chemical bonds between atoms are broken and new chemical bonds are formed.</li>
	<li class="block_759">Bond breaking absorbs energy whereas bond formation releases energy.</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_12">How are chemical reactions represented?</p>
	<p class="block_">When methane reacts with oxygen, it forms carbon dioxide and water. How can you represent this reaction? It can be written as a word equation as shown below:</p>
	<p class="block_">Methane + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water</p>
	<p class="block_">But this equation does not give the chemical composition of the reactants and products. So, to learn the characteristics of a chemical reaction, it is represented by a chemical equation. In the chemical equation, the chemicals of the reaction are represented by their chemical formulae. The compounds or elements, which undergo reactions (reactants) are shown to the left of an arrow and the compounds formed (products) are shown to the right of the arrow. The arrow indicates the direction of the reaction. Thus, the aforesaid reaction can be written as follows:</p>
	<p class="block_74">C H4 + O2 gives C O2 + H2O</p>
	<p class="block_">But this is also an incomplete chemical equation. Because, the law of conservation of matter states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. You cannot create new atoms by a chemical reaction. In contrast, they are rearranged in different ways by a chemical reaction to form a new compound. So, in a chemical equation, the number of atoms of the reactants and that of the products must be equal. The number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the reactants and the products are not equal in the given equation. On balancing the number of atoms, the following equation can be obtained:</p>
	<p class="block_760">CH<span class="text_11">4</span>+2O<span class="text_11">2gives</span>C O<span class="text_11">2</span>+2H<span class="text_11">2</span>O</p>
	<p class="block_">Further, the chemical equation provides information on the physical state of the substances and the conditions under which the reaction takes place.</p>
	<p class="block_761"><span class="text_46">CH</span><b class="calibre6">4</b>(gas)<span class="text_46">+2O</span><b class="calibre6">2</b>(gas) gives<span class="text_46"><span class="calibre28">  </span></span><span class="text_46">CO</span><b class="calibre6">2</b>(gas)<span class="text_46">+2H</span><b class="calibre6">2</b><span class="text_46">O</span>(gas)</p>

	<p class="block_763">A balanced chemical equation is the simplified representation of a chemical reaction which describes the Chemical composition, physical state of the reactants and the products, and the reaction conditions.</p>
	<p class="block_764">MORE TO KNOW</p>
	<p class="block_764">The phases or the physical state of the substances in a chemical reaction are denoted in short form within a bracket, as the subscript of the formula, of the respective substances. For example, when solid potassium reacts with liquid water, it produces hydrogen gas and potassium hydroxide solution. All these information of the reaction is given in the chemical equation as shown below:</p>
	<p class="block_764">2K(solid) + 2H2O (Liquid) gives 2KOH (aqueous) + H2(gas)</p>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_284">10.1.1 Classification based on the nature of rearrangements of atoms</h3>
	<p class="block_9">So far you studied about a chemical reaction and how it can be described as a chemical equation. A large number of chemical reactions are taking place around us every day. Are they taking place in a similar way? No. Each reaction involves different kinds of atoms and hence the way they react also differs. Thus, based on the manner by which the atoms of the reactants are rearranged, chemical reactions are classified as follows.</p>
	<p class="block_9">a. Combination reactions</p>
	<p class="block_9"><span class="calibre15">A combination reaction is a reaction in which two or more reactants combine to form a compound. It is otherwise called 'synthesis reaction' or   'composition   reaction'.   When a reactant ‘A’ combines with ‘B’, it forms the product ‘AB’. The generalised scheme of a combination reaction is given below:</span></p>
	<p class="block_18"> </p>
	<p class="block_9"><img src="images/image-149.png" alt="the image shows general formula for combination reaction A plus B gives A B" class="calibre229"/></p>
	<p class="block_9">Example: Hydrogen gas combines with chlorine gas to form hydrogen chloride gas.</p>
	<p class="block_9">H2(gas) + Cl2(gas<span class="calibre15">)  </span>gives 2HCl(gas)</p>
	<p class="block_9">Depending on the chemical nature of the reactants, there are three classes of combination reactions:</p>
	<ul class="list_4">
	<li class="block_66"><b class="calibre36">Element + Element gives Compound</b></li>
</ul>
	<p class="block_9">In this type of combination reaction, two elements react with one other to form a compound. The reaction may take place between a metal and a non-metal or two non-metals.</p>
	<p class="block_9"><b class="calibre36">Example 1:</b> When solid sulphur reacts with oxygen, it produces sulphur dioxide. Here both the reactants are non-metals.</p>
	<p class="block_9"><img src="images/image-150.png" alt="element plus element gives compound" class="calibre230"/></p>
	<p class="block_769"><span class="text_46">S</span><b class="calibre6">(solid)</b><span class="text_46">+O</span><b class="calibre6">2(gas<span class="calibre28">)  </span></b>gives<span class="text_46"> S O</span><b class="calibre6">2(gas)</b></p>
	<p class="block_9"><b class="calibre36">Example 2:</b> Sodium, a silvery-white metal, combines with chlorine, a pale-yellow green gas, to form sodium chloride, an edible compound. Here one of the reactants is a metal (sodium) and the other (chlorine) is a non- metal.</p>
	<p class="block_770">2Na<span class="text_11">(solid)</span>+Cl<span class="text_11">2(gas)</span> gives 2NaCl<span class="text_11">(solid)</span></p>

	</tbody></table>
	<ul class="list_4">
	<li class="block_66"><b class="calibre36">Compound + Element gives Compound</b></li>
</ul>
	<p class="block_9">In this case, a compound reacts with an element to form a new compound. For instance, phosphorous trichloride reacts with chlorine gas and forms phosphorous pentachloride.</p>
	<p class="block_773"><span class="text_46">P Cl</span>3(Iiquid) <span class="text_46">+Cl</span>2(gas)<span class="text_46"> gives P Cl</span>5(solid)</p>
	<ul class="list_4">
	<li class="block_66"><b class="calibre36">Compound + Compound gives Compound</b></li>
</ul>
	<p class="block_9">It is a reaction between two compounds to form a new compound. In the following reaction, silicon dioxide reacts with calcium oxide to form calcium silicate.</p>
	<p class="block_23">Si O2(solid) + Ca O(solid) gives C a S i O3(solid)</p>
	<p class="block_9">Most of the combination reactions are exothermic in nature. Because, they involve the formation of new bonds, which releases a huge amount of energy in the form of heat.</p>
	<p class="block_19">(b) Decomposition reactions</p>
	<p class="block_23">In a decomposition reaction, a single compound splits into two or more simpler substances under suitable conditions. It is the opposite of the combination reaction. The generalised scheme of a decomposition reaction is given below:</p>
	<p class="block_9"><img src="images/image384.jpeg" alt="the image shows Decomposition reactions as A B gives A + B " class="calibre231"/></p>
	<p class="block_9">Breaking of bonds is the major phenomenon in a decomposition reaction and hence it requires energy to break the bonds, depending on the nature of the energy used in the decomposition reaction.</p>
	<p class="block_9">There are three main classes of decomposition reactions. They are</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_66">Thermal Decomposition Reactions</li>
	<li class="block_66">Electrolytic Decomposition Reactions</li>
	<li class="block_66">Photo Decomposition Reactions</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_12">Do You Know?</p>
	<p class="block_74">A solution of slaked lime is used for white washing walls. Calcium hydroxide reacts slowly with the carbon di oxide in air to form a thin layer of calcium carbonate on the walls. Calcium carbonate is formed after two to three days of white washing and gives a shiny finish to the walls. It is interesting to note that the chemical formula for marble is also CaCO3.</p>
	<p class="block_">Ca (O H)twice(aqueous) + C O2(gas) gives C a C O3(solid) + H2O(Iiquid)</p>
	<p class="block_12">1. Thermal Decomposition Reactions</p>
	<p class="block_">In this type of reaction, the reactant is decomposed by applying heat. For example, on heating mercury (II) oxide is decomposed into mercury metal and oxygen gas. As the molecule is dissociated by the absorption of heat, it is otherwise called ‘Thermolysis’. It is a class of compound to element by element decomposition. i.e. a compound (Hg O) is decomposed into two elements (Hg and Oxygen).</p>
	<p class="block_74">2Hg O(solid) when heated gives 2Hg(liquid)+ O2(gas)</p>
	<p class="block_">Similarly, when calcium carbonate is heated, it breaks down in to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. It is a type of compound to compound/compound decomposition.</p>
	<p class="block_">C a C O3(solid) <span id="id_Hlk134694698" class="calibre203"> when heated gives Ca O + C O2(gas)</span></p>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">In   thermal   decomposition   reaction, heat is supplied to break the bonds. Such reactions, in which heat is absorbed, are called ‘Endothermic reactions.</span></p>
	<p class="block_12">(ii)Electrolytic Decomposition Reactions</p>
	<p class="block_">In some of the decomposition reactions, electrical energy is used to bring about the reaction. For example, decomposition of sodium chloride occurs on passing electric current through its aqueous solution. Sodium chloride decomposes in to metallic sodium and chlorine gas. This process is termed as ‘Electrolysis’.</p>
	<p class="block_74">2NaCI (aqueous)<sub class="calibre25"> </sub>undergoes electrolytic decomposition gives 2Na(solid)+CI2(gas)</p>
	<p class="block_">Here, a compound (NaCl) is converted into elements (sodium and chlorine).So it is a type of compound to element by element decomposition.</p>
	<p class="block_12">(iii)Photo Decomposition Reactions</p>
	<p class="block_">Light is another form of energy, which facilitates some of the decomposition reactions. For example, when silver bromide is exposed to light, it breaks down into silver metal and bromine gas. As the decomposition is caused by light, this kind of reaction is also called ‘Photolysis’.</p>

When they react, one of the elements of the compound-reactant is replaced by   the   element-reactant   to   form a new compound and an element. The general schematic representation of a single displacement reaction is given as:</span></p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image387.jpeg" alt="image shows general formule for Single Displacement Reactions as A + B C gives A C + B" class="calibre233"/></p>
	<p class="block_">‘A’ displaces element ‘B’ from the compound ‘B C’ and hence a single displacement reaction occurs. If zinc metal is placed in hydrochloric acid, hydrogen gas is evolved. Here, hydrogen is displaced by zinc metal and zinc chloride is formed.</p>

	<p class="block_61">F e(Solid) + Cu S O4(aqueous) → F e S O4(aqueous) + Cu(Solid) </p>
	<p class="block_">If an iron nail is placed in an aqueous solution of copper (II) sulphate as shown in Fig. 10.2, the iron displaces copper from its aqueous solution and the so formed copper deposits over the iron nail.</p>

	<p class="block_61">It is easy to propose so many reactions of this kind with different combinations of reactants. Will they all occur in practice? No. This is most easily demonstrated with halogens. Let us consider the following two reactions: 2NaCl <b class="calibre6">(aqueous) </b>+ F<b class="calibre6">2(gas) gives</b> 2Na F<b class="calibre6">(aqueous) </b>+ Cl<b class="calibre6">2(gas) </b></p>

	<p class="block_">The first reaction involves the displacement of chlorine from NaCl, by fluorine. In the second reaction, chlorine displaces fluorine from NaF. Out of these two, the second reaction will not occur. Because, fluorine is more active than chlorine and occupies the upper position in the periodic table. So, in displacement reactions, the activity of the elements and their relative position in the periodic table are the key factors to determine the feasibility of the reactions. More active elements readily displace fewer active elements from their aqueous solution. The activity series of some elements is given below:</p>

So in combustion reactions, one of the reactants must be oxygen. Combustion reactions are majorly used as heat energy sources in many of our day-to-day activities. For instance, we use LPG gas for domestic cooking purposes. We get heat and flame from LPG gas by its combustion reaction of its constituent gases. LPG is a mixture of hydrocarbon gases like propane, butane, propylene, etc. All these hydrocarbons burn with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water.</p>

	<p class="block_9">Since heat is evolved, it is an exothermic reaction. As oxygen is added, it is also an oxidation. So, combustion may be called as an exothermic oxidation. If a flame is formed (as shown in Figure 10.4), then it is called burning.</p>

	<p class="block_74"><img src="images/image402.jpeg" alt="figure 10.5 Recharging of mobile battery is shown" class="calibre241"/><img src="images/image401.jpeg" alt="figure 10.5 Burning of wood is shown.  " class="calibre242"/></p>
	<p class="block_138">Figure 10.5 Burning of wood and recharging of mobile battery</p>
	<p class="block_">You know that innumerable changes occur every day around us. Are all they permanent? For example, liquid water freezes into ice, but then ice melts into liquid water. In other words, freezing is reversed. So, it is not a permanent change. Moreover, it is a physical change. Physical changes can be reversed easily. Can chemical changes be reversed? Can the products be converted into reactants? Let us consider the burning of a wood. The carbon compounds present in the wood are burnt into carbon dioxide gas and water. Can we get back the wood immediately from carbon dioxide and water? We cannot. So, it is a permanent change. In most of the cases, we cannot. But some chemical reactions can be reversed. Our mobile phone gets energy from its lithium-ion battery by chemical reactions. It is called discharging. On recharging the mobile, these chemical reactions are reversed. Thus, chemical reactions may be reversed under suitable conditions. Hence, they are grouped into two categories such as reversible and irreversible reactions.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Reversible Reactions</p>
	<p class="block_9">A reversible reaction is a reaction that can be reversed, i.e., the products can be converted back to the reactants. A reversible reaction is represented by a double arrow with their heads in the direction opposite to each other. Thus, a reversible reaction can be represented by the following equation:</p>
	<p class="block_9"><img src="images/image403.jpeg" alt="the image shows general formula for Reversible Reactions as follows  forward reaction A B gives A + B reverse reaction A + B gives A B thus the reaction can take place in two directions so it is called as reversible reaction." class="calibre243"/></p>
	<p class="block_9">Explanation: Here, the compound ‘A B’ undergoes decomposition to form the products ‘A’ and ‘B’. It is the forward reaction. As soon as the products are formed, they combine together to form ‘A B’. It is the backward reaction. So, the reaction takes place in both the directions. Do you think then that no products are formed in the aforesaid reaction? If you think so, you are wrong. Because, even though the reaction takes place in both the directions, at the initial stage the rates (speed) of these reactions are not equal. Consider the following decomposition reaction of phosphorous pentachloride into phosphorous trichloride and chlorine.</p>
	<p class="block_61">P Cl<b class="calibre6">5(gas)<sub class="calibre25"> </sub>undergoes reversible reaction and gives </b>P Cl<b class="calibre6">3(gas)<sub class="calibre25"> </sub></b>+ Cl<b class="calibre6">2(gas)</b></p>
	<p class="block_9">The forward reaction is the decomposition of PCl5 and the backward reaction is the combination of PCl3 and Cl2. Initially, the forward reaction proceeds faster than the backward reaction. After sometimes, the speed of both the reactions become equal. So, PCl5 cannot be completely converted into the products as the reaction is reversed. It is a reversible reaction. The actual measurements of the given reaction show that the reaction is at equilibrium, but the amount of PCl5 is more than that of P Cl3 and Cl2.</p>
	<p class="block_12">MORE TO KNOW</p>
	<p class="block_">If hydrogen peroxide is poured on a wound, it decomposes into water and oxygen. The gaseous oxygen bubbles away as it is formed and thus prevent the formation of H2O2.</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-153.png" alt="the image shows Hydrogen Peroxide on a wound " class="calibre244"/></p>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">Thus, more amount   of   products   can be obtained in a reversible reaction by the periodical removal of one of the products or the periodical addition of the reactants.</span></p>

	<p class="block_19">Irreversible Reactions</p>
	<p class="block_23">The reaction that cannot be reversed is called irreversible reaction. The irreversible reactions are unidirectional, i.e., they take place only in the forward direction. Consider the combustion of coal into carbon dioxide and water.</p>
	<p class="block_61">C<b class="calibre6">(solid) </b>+ O<b class="calibre6">2(gas)<sub class="calibre25"> </sub><sub class="calibre25"> </sub>gives</b> CO<b class="calibre6">2(gas)<sub class="calibre25"> </sub></b>+ Heat</p>
	<p class="block_61">Coal + Oxygen gives <i class="calibre33">Carbon dioxide + heat.</i></p>
	<p class="block_9">In this reaction, solid coal burns with oxygen and gets converted into carbon dioxide gas and water. As the product is a gas, as soon as it is formed it escapes out of the reaction container. It is extremely hard to decompose a gas into a solid. Thus, the backward reaction is not possible in this case. So, it is an irreversible reaction. Table 10.2 provides the main differences between a reversible and an irreversible reaction:</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_286">10.2 RATE OF A CHEMICAL REACTION</h2>
	<p class="block_">So far, we discussed various types of chemical reactions and the nature of the reactants and products. Let us consider the following reactions:</p>
	<ul class="list_4">
	<li class="block_6">Rusting of iron</li>
	<li class="block_7">Digestion of food</li>
	<li class="block_7">Burning of petrol</li>
	<li class="block_8">Weathering of rock</li>
</ul>
	<p class="block_">How fast is each reaction? Rank them from the slowest to fastest. How will you determine, which is the fastest and which is the slowest? One of the ways to find out how fast a reaction is as follows: Measure the number of reactants or products before and after a specific period of time. For example, let us assume that 100 gram of a substance ‘A’ undergoes a reaction and after an hour 50 gram of ‘A’ is left.</p>
	<p class="block_">A gives<span class="calibre28">  Product</span></p>
	<p class="block_">In another instance, 100 gram of substance ‘C’ undergoes a reaction and after an hour, 20 g of ‘C’ is left.</p>
	<p class="block_800">C gives<span class="calibre28">  Product</span></p>
	<p class="block_">Can you say which is the faster reaction? In the first reaction, 50 gram of the reactant (A) is converted into products whereas in the second reaction 80 gram of the reactant is converted into products in one hour. So, the second reaction is faster. This measurement is called ‘the reaction rate’.</p>
	<p class="block_">“Rate of a reaction is the change in the amount or concentration of any one of the reactants or products per unit time”.</p>
	<p class="block_">Consider the following reaction <i class="calibre33">A </i>gives B</p>
	<p class="block_">The rate of the reaction is given by</p>
	<p class="block_"> </p>
	<p class="block_61">rate = minus d square bracket A divided by d t = + d square bracket of B divided by d t<span class="tab">      </span><span class="calibre28">   </span><span class="tab">      </span></p>
	<p class="block_">square bracket of A is concentration of A</p>
	<p class="block_">square bracket of B is concentration of B</p>
	<p class="block_">d t is change in time</p>
	<p class="block_">The negative sign indicates the decrease in the concentration of A with time.</p>
	<p class="block_">The positive sign indicates the increase in the concentration of B with time.</p>
	<p class="block_">Note: square bracket represents the concentration, ‘d’ represents the infinitesimal change in the concentration.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Why is reaction rate important?</p>
	<p class="block_">Faster the reaction, more will be the amount of the product in a specified time. So, the rate of a reaction is important for a chemist for designing a process to get a good yield of a product. Rate of reaction is also important for a food processor who hopes to slow down the reactions that cause food to spoil.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_287">10.2.1 Factors influencing the rate of a reaction</h3>
	<p class="block_">Can the rate of a reaction be changed? The rate of a reaction can be changed. For example, iron gets rusted faster in an acid than in water. Important factors that affect rate of a reaction are</p>
	<p class="block_">1. Nature of the reactants</p>
	<p class="block_">2. Concentration of the reactants</p>
	<p class="block_">3. Temperature</p>
	<p class="block_">4. Catalyst</p>
	<p class="block_">5.Pressure</p>
	<p class="block_">6. Surface area of the reactants</p>
	<p class="block_12">(1) Nature of the reactants</p>
	<p class="block_">The reaction of sodium with hydrochloric acid is faster than that with acetic acid. Do you know why? Hydrochloric acid is a stronger acid than acetic acid and thus more reactive. So, the nature of the reactants influences the reaction rate.</p>
	<p class="block_801">2Na<span class="text_48">(solid)</span>+2HCl<span class="text_48">(aquoes) gives </span>2NaCl<span class="text_48">(aqueous)</span>+H<span class="text_48">2(g)</span>(fast)</p>
	<p class="block_802">2Na<span class="text_48">(solid)</span>+2CH<span class="text_48">3</span>COOH<span class="text_48">(aqueous) </span>gives 2CH<span class="text_48">3</span>COONa<span class="text_48">(aqueous)</span>+H<span class="text_48">2(gas)</span>(slow)</p>
	<p class="block_19">(ii) Concentration of the reactants</p>
	<p class="block_9">Changing the amount of the reactants also increases the reaction rate. The amount of the substance present in a certain volume of the solution is called ‘concentration’. More the concentration, more particles per volume exist in it and hence faster the reaction. Granulated zinc reacts faster with </p>
	<p class="block_9">2M hydrochloric acid than 1M hydrochloric acid.</p>
	<p class="block_19">(iii) Temperature</p>
	<p class="block_9">Most of the reactions go faster at higher temperature. Because adding heat to the reactants provides energy to break more bonds and thus speed up the reaction. Calcium carbonate reacts slowly with hydrochloric acid at room temperature. When the reaction mixture is heated the reaction rate increases.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Do You Know?</p>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">Food kept at room temperature spoils faster  than  that  kept in the refrigerator. In the refrigerator, the temperature is lower than the room temperature and hence the reaction rate is less.</span></p>
	<p class="block_12">(iv) Pressure</p>
	<p class="block_">If the reactants are gases, increasing their pressure increases the reaction rate. This is because, on increasing the pressure the reacting particles come closer and collide frequently.</p>
	<p class="block_12">(5) Catalyst</p>
	<p class="block_">A catalyst is a substance which increases the reaction rate without being consumed in the reaction. In certain reactions, adding a substance as catalyst speeds up the reaction. For example, on heating potassium chlorate, it decomposes into potassium chloride and oxygen gas, but at a slower rate. If manganese dioxide is added, it increases the reaction rate.</p>
	<p class="block_12">(vi) Surface area of the reactants</p>
	<p class="block_">When solid reactants are involved in a reaction, their powdered form reacts more readily. For example, powdered calcium carbonate reacts more readily with hydrochloric acid than marble chips. Because, powdering of the reactants increases the surface area and more energy is available on collision of the reactant particles. Thus, the reaction rate is increased.</p>
	<p class="block_">You will study more about reaction rate in you higher classes.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_288">10.3 STATE OF EQUILIBRIUM</h2>
	<p class="block_">In a reversible reaction, both forward and backward reactions take place simultaneously. When the rate of the forward reaction becomes equal to the rate of backward reaction, then no more product is formed. This stage of the reaction is called ‘equilibrium state’. After this stage, no net change in the reaction can occur and hence in the amount of the reactants and products. Since this equilibrium is attained in a chemical reaction, it is called ‘Chemical Equilibrium’. </p>
	<p class="block_">Chemical Equilibrium: It is state of a reversible chemical reaction in which no change in the amount of the reactants and products takes place. At equilibrium,</p>
	<p class="block_">Rate of forward reaction = Rate of backward reaction.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Explanation:</b><span class="calibre28"> Initially the rate of the forward reaction is greater than the rate of the backward reaction. However, during the course of reaction, the concentration of the reactants decreases   and   the   concentration of the products increases. Since the rate of a reaction is directly proportional to the concentration, the rate of the forward reaction decreases with time, whereas the rate of the backward reaction increases.</span></p>
	<p class="block_">At a certain stage, both the rates become equal. From this point onwards, there will be no change in the concentrations of both the reactants and the products with time. This state is called as equilibrium state.</p>
	<p class="block_">Let us consider the decomposition of calcium carbonate into lime and carbon dioxide. It is a reversible reaction. The speed of each reaction can be determined by how quickly the reactant disappears. If the reaction is carried out in a closed vessel, it reaches a chemical equilibrium. At this stage,</p>
	<p class="block_803">C a C O<b class="calibre6">3(solid) undergoes reversible reaction and gives </b>C<span class="calibre28">  </span>aO<b class="calibre6">(solid) </b>+ C O<b class="calibre6">2(gas)</b></p>
	<p class="block_803">The rate of decomposition of C a C O3 = The rate of combination of C a O and C O2</p>
	<p class="block_803">Not only chemical changes, physical changes also may attain equilibrium. When water kept in a closed vessel evaporates, it forms water vapour. No water vapour escapes out of the container as the process takes place in a closed vessel. So, it builds up the vapour pressure in the container. At one time, the water vapour condenses back into liquid water and when the rate of this condensation becomes equal to that of vaporisation, the process attains equilibrium.</p>
	<p class="block_803">At this stage, the volume of the liquid and gaseous phases remains constant. Since it is a physical change, the equilibrium attained is called ‘Physical Equilibrium’. Physical equilibrium is a state of a physical change at which the volume of all the phases remains unchanged.</p>
	<p class="block_803"><span class="calibre28">                   </span></p>

	<p class="block_12">Characteristics of equilibrium</p>
	<ul class="list_4">
	<li class="block_6">In a chemical equilibrium, the rates of the forward and backward reactions are equal.</li>
	<li class="block_7">The observable properties such as pressure, concentration, colour, density, viscosity etc., of the system remain unchanged with time.</li>
	<li class="block_7">The chemical equilibrium is a dynamic equilibrium, because both the forward and backward reactions continue to occur even though it appears static externally.</li>
	<li class="block_8">In physical equilibrium, the volume of all the phases remain constant.</li>
</ul>
	<p class="block_12">Do You Know?</p>
	<p class="block_">Aerated soft drinks contain dissolved carbon dioxide in a pop bottle (Soda). When the bottle is sealed,the dissolved carbon dioxide (in the form of carbonic acid) and gaseous C O2 are in equilibrium with each other. When you open the bottle, the gaseous C O2 can escape. So, the dissolved C O2 begins to undissolve back to the gas phase trying to replace the gas that was lost, <span class="calibre28">when you opened the bottle. That’s why if you leave it open long enough, it  goes ‘flat’. All the C</span> O2 will be gone, blown away in the air.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_289">10.4 IONIC PRODUCT OF WATER</h2>
	<p class="block_">Although pure water is often considered as a non-conductor of electricity, precise measurements show that it conducts electricity to a little extent. This conductivity of water has resulted from the self-ionisation of water. Self- ionisation or auto ionisation is a reaction in which two like molecules react to give ions. In the process of ionisation of water, a proton from one water molecule is transferred to another water molecule leaving behind an O H negative ion. The proton gets dissolved in water forming the hydronium ion as shown in the following equation:</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-154.png" alt="the image shows IONIC PRODUCT OF WATER 2 water molecules combine to give H3O positive ion and one O H negative ion. H2O (Liquid) + H2O (liquid) gives H 3 O positive ion (aqueous) + O H minus ion (aqueous)." class="calibre246"/></p>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">The hydronium ion formed is a strong acid and the hydroxyl ion is a strong base. So as fast as they are formed, they react again to produce water. Thus, it is a reversible reaction and attains equilibrium very quickly.   So, the extent of ionisation is very little and the concentration of the ions produced is also very less. The product of the concentration of the hydronium ion and the hydroxyl ion is called‘ionic product of water’. It is denoted as ‘K</span> w’. It is mathematically expressed as follows:</p>
	<p class="block_804">K w = concentration of H3O+ ion into concentration of O H negative ion. </p>
	<p class="block_">Concentrarion of H3O + ion  may be simply written as concentration of H +ion. Thus the ionic product of water may also be expressed as</p>
	<p class="block_805">K w = concentration of H + ion in to concentration of O H negative ion.</p>
	<p class="block_">Its unit is mol square deci meter power minus 6. At 25° C, its value is 1.00 × 10power minus 14.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_290">10.5 pH SCALE</h2>
	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">All the aqueous solutions may contain hydrogen and hydroxyl ions due to self- ionisation of water. In addition to this ionisation, substances dissolved in   water also may produce hydrogen ions or hydroxyl ions. The concentration of these ions decides whether the solution is acidic or basic. pH scale is a scale for measuring the hydrogen ion concentration in a solution. The 'p' in pH stands for ‘Potenz’ in German meaning 'power'. pH notation was devised by the Danish biochemist Sorensen in 1909. pH scale is a set of numbers from 0 to 14 which is used to indicate whether a solution is acidic, basic or neutral.</span></p>
	<ul class="list_4">
	<li class="block_6">Acids have pH less than 7</li>
	<li class="block_7">Bases have pH greater than 7</li>
	<li class="block_8">A neutral solution has pH equal to 7</li>
</ul>
	<p class="block_">The pH is the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration</p>
	<p class="block_">That is  pH = minus log base 10 concentration of H+ ion</p>

	<p class="block_">How can we measure the pH of a given solution using pH Paper</p>
	<p class="block_">The pH of a solution can be determined by using a universal indicator. It contains a mixture of dyes. It comes in the form of a solution or a pH paper.</p>

	<p class="block_138">Figure 10.7 pH Indicator</p>
	<p class="block_9">A more common method of measuring pH in a school laboratory is by using the pH paper. A pH paper contains a mixture of indicators. It shows a specific colour at a given pH. A colour guide is provided with the bottle of the indicator or the strips of paper impregnated with it, which are called pH paper strips. The test solution is tested with a drop of the universal indicator, or a drop of the test solution is put on the pH paper. The colour of the solution on the pH paper is compared with the colour chart and the pH value is read from it. The pH values thus obtained are only approximate values.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_291">10.6 ROLE OF pH IN EVERYDAY LIFE</h2>
	<p class="block_12">Are plants and animals pH sensitive?</p>
	<p class="block_">Our body works within the pH range of 7.0 to 7.8. Living organisms can survive only in a narrow range of pH change. Different body fluids have different pH values. For example, pH of blood is ranging from 7.35 to 7.45. Any increase or decrease in this value leads to diseases. The ideal pH for blood is 7.4.</p>
	<p class="block_19">pH in our digestive system</p>
	<p class="block_23">It is very interesting to note that our stomach produces hydrochloric acid. It helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach. During indigestion the stomach produces too much acid and this causes pain and irritation. pH of the stomach fluid is approximately 2.0.</p>
	<p class="block_19">pH changes as the cause of tooth decay</p>
	<p class="block_23">pH of the saliva normally ranges between6.5 to 7.5. White enamel coating of our teeth is calcium phosphate, the hardest substance in our body. When the pH of the mouth saliva falls below 5.5, the enamel gets weathered. Toothpastes, which are generally basic are used for cleaning the teeth that can neutralise the excess acid and prevent tooth decay.</p>
	<p class="block_19">pH of soil</p>
	<p class="block_9">In agriculture, the pH of the soil is very important. Citrus fruits require slightly alkaline soil, while rice requires acidic soil and sugarcane requires neutral soil.</p>
	<p class="block_19">pH of rain water</p>
	<p class="block_23">The pH of rain water is approximately 7, which means that it is neutral and also represents its high purity. If the atmospheric air is polluted with oxide gases of sulphur and nitrogen, they get dissolved in the rain water and make its pH less than 7. Thus, if the pH of rain water is less than 7, then it is called acid rain. When acid rain flows into the rivers it lowers the pH of the river water also.</p>
	<p class="block_23"><img src="images/image-156.png" alt="image shows conceptual thoughts Why is pure water has ph 7 at room temperature" class="calibre248"/></p>
	<p class="block_9">The survival of aquatic life in such rivers becomes difficult.</p>

	<p class="block_12">pH + p O H = 14</p>
	<p class="block_823">If either the pH or the p O H of a solution is known, the other value can be calculated.</p>

	<p class="block_826">10.8 Problems</p>
	<p class="block_826">Example 1: Calculate the pH of 0.001 molar solution of HCl.</p>
	<p class="block_826">Solution: HCl is a strong acid and is completely dissociated in its solutions according to the</p>
	<p class="block_826">process: </p>
	<p class="block_826">HCl(aqueous) gives H+ ion(aqueous) + Cl negative ion (aqueous)</p>
	<p class="block_826">From this process it is clear that one mole of HCl would give one mole of H+ions.</p>
	<p class="block_826">Therefore, the concentration of H+ ions would be equal to that of HCl, that is 0.001 molar or</p>
	<p class="block_826">1.0 × 10 power minus 3  mol litre power minus 1.</p>
	<p class="block_826">Thus, concentration of H+ ion = 1 × 10 power minus3 mol litre power minus 1</p>
	<p class="block_826">pH = minus log base 10 concentration of H+ ion = minus log base10 10 power minus3</p>
	<p class="block_826">= minus into (minus3 × log base10 10) = (3 × 1) = 3</p>
	<p class="block_826">Thus, pH = 3</p>
	<p class="block_826">Example 2: What would be the pH of an aqueous solution of sulphuricacid which is 5 × 10 power minus 5 mol litre power minus 1 in concentration.</p>
	<p class="block_826">Solution: Sulphuric acid dissociates in water as:</p>
	<p class="block_826">H2 S O 4(aqueous) gives 2 H+(aqueous) + S O4 2miuns ion (aqueous)</p>
	<p class="block_826">Each mole of sulphuric acid gives two mole of H+ ions in the solution. One litre of H2</p>
	<p class="block_826">S O4 solution contains 5 × 10 power minus 5 moles of H2 S O4 which would give 2 × 5 × 10 power minus 5 = 10 × 10 power minus 5 or 1.0 × 10 power minus 4 moles of H+ ion in one litre of the solution.</p>
	<p class="block_826">Therefore,</p>
	<p class="block_826">Concentration H+ ion = 1.0 × 10 power minus 4 mol litre power minus 1</p>
	<p class="block_826">pH = minus log base10 concentration of H+ ion</p>
	<p class="block_826"> = minus log base 10 10 power minus 4 </p>
	<p class="block_826">= minus into (minus4 × log base10 10)</p>
	<p class="block_826">= minus into(minus4 × 1) = 4</p>
	<p class="block_826">Example 3: Calculate the pH of 1 × 10 power minus 4  molar solution of NaOH.</p>
	<p class="block_826">Solution: NaOH is a strong base and dissociates in its solution as:</p>
	<p class="block_826">Na O H(aqueous) gives Na +ion (aqueous) + O H minus ion (aqueous)</p>
	<p class="block_826">One mole of NaOH would give one mole ofO H negative ion. Therefore</p>
	<p class="block_826">Concentration of O H negative ion = 1 × 10 power minus 4 mol litre power minus 1</p>
	<p class="block_826">p O H = minus log base10 concentration of O H negative ion</p>
	<p class="block_826"> = minus log base10 × [10power minus 4]</p>
	<p class="block_826">= minus into (minus 4 × log base10 10)</p>
	<p class="block_826">= minus into (minus 4) = 4</p>
	<p class="block_827"> </p>
	<p class="block_826">Since, pH + p O H = 14</p>
	<p class="block_826">pH = 14 minus p O H = 14 minus 4 </p>
	<p class="block_826">= 10.</p>
	<p class="block_826">Example 4: Calculate the pH of a solution in which the concentration of the hydrogen ions is 1.0 × 10 power minus 8 mol litre power minus 1.</p>
	<p class="block_826">Solution: Here, although the solution is extremely dilute, the concentration given is not of an acid or a base but that of H+ ions. Hence, the pH can be calculated from the relation:</p>
	<p class="block_826">pH = minus log base10 concentration of H+ ion</p>
	<p class="block_826">given concentration of H+ ion = 1.0 × 10 power minus 8 mol litre power minus 1</p>
	<p class="block_826">pH = minus log base 10 10 power minus8 </p>
	<p class="block_826">= minus into (minus 8 × log base10 10)</p>
	<p class="block_826">= minus into (minus8 × 1) </p>
	<p class="block_826">= 8</p>
	<p class="block_826">Example 5: If the pH of a solution is 4.5, what is its p O H?</p>
	<p class="block_826">Solution:</p>
	<p class="block_826">pH + p O H = 14</p>
	<p class="block_826">p O H = 14 minus 4.5 = 9.5</p>
	<p class="block_826">pOH = 9.5</p>

	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">You have studied, in your lower classes, that carbon is an inseparable element in human life as we use innumerable number of carbon compounds in our day-to-day life. Because, the food we eat, medicines we take when ill, clothes we wear; domestic and automobile fuels, paint, cosmetics, automobile parts, etc., that we use contain   carbon   compounds.   The   number of carbon compounds found in nature and man-made, is much higher than that of any other element in the periodic table. In fact there are more than 5 million compounds of carbon. The unique nature of carbon, such as catenation, tetravalency and multiple bonding, enables it to combine with itself or other elements like hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur etc., and hence form large number of compounds. All these compounds are made of covalent bonds. These compounds are called organic compounds. In this lesson, you will learn about carbon compounds.</span></p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_298">11.1 GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS</h2>
	<p class="block_23">Everything in this world has unique character, similarly organic compounds are unique in their characteristics. Some of them are given below:</p>
	<ul class="list_4">
	<li class="block_66">Organic compounds have a high molecular weight and a complex structure.</li>
	<li class="block_66">They are mostly insoluble in water, but soluble in organic solvents such as ether, carbon tetrachloride, toluene, etc.</li>
	<li class="block_66">They are highly inflammable in nature</li>
	<li class="block_66">Organic compounds are less reactive compared to inorganic compounds. Hence, the reactions involving organic compounds proceed at slower rates.</li>
	<li class="block_66">Mostly organic compounds form covalent bonds in nature.</li>
	<li class="block_66">They have lower melting point and boiling point when compared to inorganic compounds</li>
	<li class="block_66">They exhibit the phenomenon of isomerism, in which a single molecular formula represents several organic compounds that differ in their physical and chemical properties</li>
	<li class="block_66">They are volatile in nature.</li>
	<li class="block_66">Organic compounds can be prepared in the laboratory</li>
</ul>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_299">11.2 CLASSIFICATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS BASED ON THE PATTERN OF CARBON CHAIN</h2>
	<p class="block_">What is the significance of classification? There are millions of organic compounds known and many new organic compounds are discovered every year in nature or synthesized in laboratory. This may mystify organic chemistry to a large extent. However, a unique molecular structure can be assigned to each compound and it can be listed by using systematic methods of classification and eventually named on the basis of its structural arrangements. In early days, chemists recognised that compounds having similar structural features have identical chemical properties. So they began to classify compounds based on the common structural arrangements found among them.</p>
	<p class="block_">Organic chemistry is the chemistry of catenated carbon compounds. The carbon atoms present in organic compounds are linked with each other through covalent bonds and thus exist as chains. By this way, organic compounds are classified into two types as follows: </p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">1. Acyclic or Open chain compounds:</b> These are the compounds in which the carbon atoms are linked in a linear pattern to form the chain. If all the carbon atoms in the chain are connected by single bonds, the compound is called as saturated. If one or more double bonds or triple bonds exist between the carbon atoms, then the compound is said to unsaturated.</p>
	<h5 class="block_832"><b class="calibre36">CH3-CH2-CH3<span class="tab1">      </span>CH</b><b class="calibre36">3-CH double bond CH2</b></h5>

	<p class="block_834">Saturated compound<span class="tab">      </span>Unsaturated compound</p>
	<p class="block_">2. Cyclic Compounds: Organic compounds in which the chain of carbon atoms is closed or cyclic are called cyclic compounds. If the chain contains only carbon atoms, such compounds are called carbocyclic (homocyclic)compounds. If the chain contains carbon and other atoms like oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, etc., these compounds are called heterocyclic compounds. Carbocyclic compounds are further subdivided into alicyclic and aromatic compounds. Alicyclic compounds contain one or more carbocyclic rings which may be saturated or unsaturated whereas aromatic compounds contain one or more benzene rings (ring containing alternate double bonds between carbon atoms). E.g.</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_300">11.3 CLASSES OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (BASED ON THE KIND OF ATOMS)</h2>
	<p class="block_">Other than carbon, organic compounds contain atoms like hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, etc., bonded to the carbon. Combination of these kinds of atoms with carbon gives different classes of organic compounds. In the following section, let us discuss various classes of organic compounds.</p>
	<h4 class="block_103"><span class="calibre28">11.3.1  Hydrocarbons</span></h4>
	<p class="block_9">The organic compounds that are composed of only carbon and hydrogen atoms are called hydrocarbons. The carbon atoms join together to form the framework of the compounds. These are regarded as the parent organic compounds and all other compounds are considered to be derived from hydrocarbons by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms with other atoms or group of atoms. Hydrocarbons are, further, sub divided into three classes such as:</p>
	<p class="block_9"><b class="calibre36">(a)Alkanes:</b> These are hydrocarbons, which contain only single bonds. They are represented by the general formula Cn H 2n + 2 (where n = 1,2, 3, ……). The simplest alkane (for n=1) is methane (C H4). Since, all are single bonds in alkanes, they are saturated compounds.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">(b)Alkenes:</b> The hydrocarbons, which contain one or more C=C bonds are called alkenes. These are unsaturated compounds. They are represented by the general formula CnH2n. The simplest alkene contains two carbon atoms (n=2) and is called ethylene (C2 H4).</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">(c)Alkynes:</b> The hydrocarbons containing carbon to carbon triple bond are called alkynes. They are also unsaturated as they contain triple bond between carbon atoms. They have the general formula Cn H 2n – 2. Acetylene (C2 H2) is the simplest alkyne, which contains two carbon atoms. Table 11.1 lists the first five hydrocarbons of each class:</p>

	<p class="block_9">The structural frameworks of organic compounds are made of carbon and hydrogen, which are relatively less reactive. But, the presence of some other atoms or group of atoms makes the compounds more reactive and thus determines the chemical properties of the compound. These groups are called functional groups.</p>
	<p class="block_">A functional group is an atom or group of atoms in a molecule, which gives its characteristic chemical properties.</p>
	<p class="block_">The chemical properties of an organic compound depend on its functional group whereas its physical properties rely on remaining part of the structure. Carbon to carbon multiple bonds </p>
	<p class="block_">(C double bond C, C triple bond C) also are considered as functional groups as many of the properties are influenced by these bonds. Other functional groups include atoms of halogens, –O H, –C H O, –COOH, etc.</p>
	<p class="block_">For example, ethane is a hydrocarbon having molecular formula C2H6. If one of its hydrogens is replaced by –O H group, you will get an alcohol. Leaving the functional group, the rest of the structure is represented by ‘R’. Thus an alcohol is represented by ‘R-O H’</p>

	<h4 class="block_103">11.5.1 Why do we need nomenclature?</h4>
	<p class="block_">In ancient days, the names of organic compounds were related to the natural things from which they were obtained. For example, the formic acid was initially obtained by distillation of ‘red ants. Latin name of the red ant is ‘Formica’. So, the name of the formic acid was derived from the Latin name of its source Later, the organic compounds were synthesized from sources other than the natural sources. So scientists framed a systematic method for naming the organic compounds based on their structures. Hence, a set of rules was formulated by IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) for the nomenclature of chemical compounds.</p>
	<p class="block_12">11.5.2 Components of an IUPAC name</p>
	<p class="block_">The IUPAC name of the any organic compound consists of three parts:</p>
	<p class="block_">1. Root word</p>
	<p class="block_">ii. Prefix</p>
	<p class="block_">iii. Suffix</p>
	<p class="block_">These parts are combined as per the following sequence to get the IUPAC name of the compound:</p>
	<p class="block_901"><span class="text_56">Prefix</span><span class="text_57"> + </span><span class="text_58">Root</span><span class="text_59"> Word </span><span class="text_57">+</span><span class="text_60"> Suffix gives</span> <span class="text_60">IUPAC Name</span></p>
	<p class="block_9"><b class="calibre36">(1)Root word:</b> It is the basic unit, which describes the carbon skeleton. It gives the number of carbon atoms present in the parent chain of the compound and the pattern of their arrangement. Based on the number of carbon atoms present in the carbon skeleton, most of the names are derived from Greek numerals (except the first four). Table 11.3 shows the root words for the parent chain of hydrocarbons containing 1to10 carbon atoms:</p>

Molasses is   a dark coloured syrupy liquid left after the crystallization of sugar from the concentrated sugarcane juice. Molasses contains about 30% of sucrose, which cannot be separated by crystallization. It is converted into ethanol by the following steps:</span></p>
	<p class="block_19">(i) Dilution of molasses</p>
	<p class="block_9">Molasses is first diluted with water to bring down the concentration of sugar to about 8 to 10 percent.</p>
	<p class="block_19">(ii) Addition of Nitrogen source</p>
	<p class="block_9">Molasses usually contains enough nitrogenous matter to act as food for yeast during the fermentation process. If the nitrogen content of the molasses is poor, it may be fortified by the addition of ammonium sulphate or ammonium phosphate.</p>
	<p class="block_19">(iii) Addition of Yeast</p>
	<p class="block_9">The solution obtained in step (ii) is collected in large ‘fermentation tanks and yeast are added to it. The mixture is kept at about 303 Kelvin for a few days. During this period, the enzymes invertase and zymase present in yeast, bring about the conversion of sucrose into ethanol.</p>

	<p class="block_61"> C6 H12 O6 (glucose or fructose) in the presence of zymase gives 2C2 H5 O H ethanol + 2 C O2</p>
	<p class="block_12">The fermented liquid is technically called wash.</p>
	<p class="block_19">(iv) Distillation of 'Wash'</p>
	<p class="block_9">The fermented liquid (i.e. wash), containing 15 to 18 percent alcohol, is now subjected to fractional distillation. The main fraction drawn is an aqueous solution of ethanol which contains 95.5% of ethanol and 4.5% of water. This is called rectified spirit. This mixture is then refluxed over quicklime for about 5 to 6 hours and then allowed to stand for 12 hours. On distillation of this mixture, pure alcohol (100%) is obtained. This is called absolute alcohol.</p>

	<p class="block_9">Yeast and Fermentation: Yeasts are single–celled microorganisms, belonging to the class of fungi. The enzymes present in yeasts catalyse many complex organic reactions.

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_315">11.9 SOAPS AND DETERGENTS</h2>
	<p class="block_">Soaps and the Detergents are materials that are used by us for cleaning purposes because pure water alone cannot remove all types of dirt or any oily substance from our body or clothes. They contain ‘surfactants’, which are compounds with molecules that line up around water to break the ‘surface tension’. Both of them having a different chemical nature. Soap is a cleaning agent that is composed of one or more salts of fatty acids. Detergent is a chemical compound or a mixture of chemical compounds, which is used as a cleaning agent, also. They perform their cleaning actions in certain specific conditions. You will learn more about this in detail, in the following units.</p>
	<p class="block_12"><span class="calibre28">11.9.1   Soap</span></p>
	<p class="block_">Soaps are sodium or potassium salts of some long chain carboxylic acids, called fatty acids. Soap requires two major raw materials: i) fat and ii) alkali. The alkali, most commonly used in the preparation of soap is sodium hydroxide. Potassium hydroxide can also be used. A potassium-based soap creates a more water- soluble product than a sodium-based soap. Based on these features, there are two types of soaps:</p>
	<p class="block_12">A. HARD SOAP</p>
	<p class="block_">Soaps, which are prepared by the saponification of oils or fats with caustic soda (sodium hydroxide), are known as hard soaps. They are usually used for washing purposes.</p>
	<p class="block_12">B. SOFT SOAP</p>
	<p class="block_">Soaps, which are prepared by the saponification of oils or fats with potassium salts, are known as soft soaps. They are used for cleansing the body.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Manufacture of soap</p>
	<p class="block_12">KETTLE PROCESS:</p>
	<p class="block_">This is the oldest method. But, it is still widely used in the small scale preparation ofsoap. There are mainly, two steps to be followed in this process.</p>
	<p class="block_12">1) Saponification of oil:</p>
	<p class="block_">The oil, which is used in this process, is taken in an iron tank (kettle). The alkaline solution (10%) is added into the kettle, a little in excess. The mixture is boiled by passing steam through it. The oil gets hydrolysed after several hours of boiling. This process is called Saponification</p>
	<p class="block_12">ii) Salting out of soap:</p>
	<p class="block_">Common salt is then added to the boiling mixture. Soap is finally precipitated in the tank. After several hours the soap rises to the top of the liquid as a ‘curdy mass’. The neat soap is taken off from the top. It is then allowed to cool down.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Effect of hard water on soap</p>
	<p class="block_">Hard water contains calcium and magnesium ions (C a2 + and M g2+) that limit the cleaning action of soap. When combined with soap, hard water develops a thin layer (precipitates of the metal ions) called ‘scum’, which leaves a deposit on the clothes or skin and does not easily rinse away. Over time, this can lead to the deterioration of the fabric and eventually ruin the clothes. On the other hand, detergents are made with chemicals that are not affected by hard water.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Do You Know?</p>
	<p class="block_">Why ordinary soap is not suitable for using with hard water?</p>
	<p class="block_">Ordinary soaps when treated with hard water, precipitate as salts of calcium and magnesium. They appearat the surface of the cloth as sticky grey scum. Thus, the soaps cannot be used conveniently in hard water.</p>
	<p class="block_12"><span class="calibre28">11.9.2    Detergents</span></p>
	<p class="block_">Development of synthetic detergents is a big achievement in the field of cleansing. These soaps possess the desirable properties of ordinary soaps and also can be used with hard water and in acidic solutions. These are salts of sulphonic acids or alkyl hydrogen sulphates in comparison to soap, which are salts of carboxylic acids. The detergents do not form precipitates with C a 2+ and M g 2+ present in hard water. So, the cleansing action of detergents is better than that of soaps.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Preparation of detergents</p>
	<p class="block_">Detergents are prepared by adding sulphuric acid to the processed hydrocarbon obtained from petroleum. This chemical reaction result in the formation of molecules similar to the fatty acid in soap. Then, an alkali is added to the mixture to produce the ‘surfactant molecules’, which do not bond with the minerals present in the hard water, thus preventing the formation of their precipitates.</p>
	<p class="block_">In addition to a ‘surfactant’, the modern detergent contains several other ingredients. They are listed as follows:</p>
	<p class="block_">1) Sodium silicate, which prevents the corrosion and ensures that the detergent does not damage the washing machine.</p>
	<p class="block_">ii) Fluorescent whitening agents that give a glow to the clothes.</p>
	<p class="block_">iii) Oxygen bleaches, such as ‘sodium perborate’, enable the removal of certain stains from the cloth.</p>
	<p class="block_">iv) Sodium sulphate is added to prevent the caking of the detergent powder.</p>
	<p class="block_">5) Enzymes are added to break down some stains caused by biological substances like blood and vegetable juice.</p>
	<p class="block_">vi) Certain chemicals that give out a pleasant smell are also added to make the clothes fragrant after they are washed with detergents.</p>

	<p class="block_"><span class="calibre28">A soap molecule contains two chemically distinct parts that interact differently with water. It has one polar end, which is a short head with a carboxylate group (–COONa) and one non-polar   end   having the long tail made of the hydrocarbon chain.</span></p>
	<p class="block_">The polar end is hydrophilic (Water loving) in nature and this end is attracted towards water. The non-polar end is hydrophobic (Water hating) in nature and it is attracted towards dirt or oil on the cloth, but not attracted towards water. Thus, the hydrophobic part of the soap molecule traps the dirt and the hydrophilic part makes the entire molecule soluble in water.</p>
	<p class="block_">When a soap or detergent is dissolved in water, the molecules join together as clusters called ‘micelles’. Their long hydrocarbon chains attach themselves to the oil and dirt. The dirt is thus surrounded by the non-polar end of the soap molecules (Figure 11.3). The charged carboxylate end of the soap molecules makes the micelles soluble in water. Thus, the dirt is washed away with the soap.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Advantages of detergents over soaps</p>
	<p class="block_">Detergents are better than soaps because they:</p>
	<ul class="list_4">
	<li class="block_6">can be used in both hard and soft water and can clean more effectively in hard water than soap.</li>
	<li class="block_7">can also be used in saline and acidic water.</li>

Mitochondria (singular: mitochondrion) are organelles within eukaryotic cells that produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which form the energy currency of the cell, for this reason, the mitochondria is referred to as the “Powerhouse of the cell”. Mitochondria vary in size from 0.5 mew m to 2.0 mew m. </p>
	<p class="block_1001">Mitochondria contain 60-70% protein, 25-30% lipids, 5-7% RNA and small amount of DNA and minerals.</p>

	<p class="block_1001"><b class="calibre36">Mitochondrial Membranes</b>: It consists of two membranes called inner and outer membrane. Each membrane is 60 to 70  Angstrom  thick. Outer mitochondrial membrane is smooth and freely permeable to most small molecules. It contains enzymes, proteins and lipids. It has porin molecules (proteins) which form channels for passage of molecules through it.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Inner mitochondrial membrane is semi permeable membrane and regulates the passage of materials into and out of the mitochondria. It is rich in enzymes and carrier proteins. It consists of 80% proteins and lipids.</p>

	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Cristae:</b> The inner mitochondrial membrane gives rise to finger like projections called cristae. These cristae increase the inner surface area (fold in inner membrane) of the mitochondria to hold variety of enzymes.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Oxysomes:</b> The inner mitochondrial membrane bear minute regularly spaced tennis racket shaped particles known as oxysomes (F1particle). They involve in ATP synthesis.</p>

	<p class="block_1054"><img src="images/image789.jpeg" alt="Image which shows the Tree intake oxygen and expels carbon dioxide in the night and vice verse in the Day " class="calibre285"/></p>
	<p class="block_1054">Respiration involves exchange of gases between the organism and the external environment. The plants obtain oxygen from their environment and release carbon dioxide and water vapour. This exchange of gases is known as external respiration. It is a physical process. Biochemical process occurs within cells where the food is oxidized to obtain energy, this is known as cellular respiration.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_348">12.11.1 Aerobic respiration</h3>
	<p class="block_985"><span class="text_4">Aerobic respiration is the type of cellular respiration in which organic food is completely oxidized with the help of oxygen into carbon dioxide, water and energy. It occurs in most plants and animals.</span> </p>

	<p class="block_12">a. </p>
	<p class="block_12">Glycolysis (Glucose splitting):</p>
	<p class="block_"> It is the breakdown of one molecule of glucose (6 carbon) into two molecules of pyruvic acid (3 carbon). Glycolysis takes place in cytoplasm of the cell. It is the first step of both aerobic and anaerobic respiration.</p>
	<p class="block_12">b.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6"> Krebs Cycle:</b> This cycle occurs in mitochondria matrix. At the end of glycolysis, 2 molecules of pyruvic acid enter into mitochondria. The oxidation of pyruvic acid into C O2 and water takes place through this cycle. It is also called Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle (TCA).</p>
	<p class="block_12">c.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6"> Electron Transport Chain:</b> This is accomplished through a system of electron carrier complex called electron transport chain (E T C) located on the inner membrane of the mitochondria. NADH+H+ and FADH2 molecules formed during glycolysis and Krebs cycle are oxidised to N A D+ and F A D to release the energy via electrons. The electrons, as they move through the system, release energy which is trapped by ADP to synthesize ATP. This is called oxidative phosphorylation. In this process, O2 the ultimate acceptor of electrons gets reduced to water.</p>

	<p class="block_1054">The variety in nature and habits of animals in the biosphere are quite amazing and interesting. What we see around us may be just few, but there are innumerable species living in this world. You have learnt in lower classes about the classification of animal kingdom. We will recall here that ‘Kingdom Animalia’ is divided into two groups, Invertebrates and Chordates.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">There occurs a great diversity in the habit, habitat, structural organisation and mode of reproduction between the animals existing on earth. In this chapter, you will understand the structural morphology and anatomy of an Invertebrate (Leech) and a Vertebrate (Rabbit).</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The scientific name of the Indian cattle leech is Hirudinaria granulosa which belongs to Phylum Annelida. Annelids are metamerically segmented worms with well-developed organ systems.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The scientific name of the common rabbit is Oryctolagus cuniculus. It is representing Phylum Chordata and Class Mammalia. Mammals occupy the highest group in the animal kingdom and show advancement over the other groups of animals. They are warm blooded and possess covering of hair on the body. Mammary gland in females is the most striking feature of a mammal. Let us now study about the morphology of leech and rabbit in detail.</p>

	<p class="block_1001">Hirudinaria granulosa (Indian Cattle Leech) is found in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. It lives in freshwater ponds, lakes, swamps and slow streams. They are ectoparasitic and feed on the blood of fishes, frogs, cattle and human. It is sanguivorous (blood sucking) in nature.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_375">13.1.2External Morphology</h3>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Shape and Size:</b> The body of a leech is soft, vermiform, elongated and segmented. It becomes ribbon shaped when extended and almost cylindrical when contracted. Leeches may grow to a length of 35cm.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Colouration:</b> Dorsal surface is olive green in colour and the ventral surface is orange yellow or orange red in colour.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Segmentation:</b> Metamerism is the segmentation of the body. The body of leech is metamerically divided into 33 segments. The segments are arranged one behind the other. Each segment is further superficially subdivided into rings or annuli. A temporary clitellum is formed on segments 9-11, which is meant to produce a cocoon during the breeding season.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Receptors:</b> On the dorsal side there are five pairs of eyes on the first five segments. Each segment bears a number of sensory projections called receptors. Annular receptors are located in each annulus and segmental receptors are located on the first annulus of each segment.</p>

	<p class="block_1001">The digestive system includes the long alimentary canal and the digestive glands.</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Alimentary Canal</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The alimentary canal of leech is a straight tube running from the mouth to the anus. Mouth is a triradiate aperture situated in the middle of the anterior sucker that leads into the small buccal cavity. The wall of the buccal cavity bears three jaws with single row of minute teeth. The jaws are provided with papillae which bear the openings of salivary glands. Mouth and buccal cavity occupy the first five segments.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The buccal cavity leads into muscular pharynx. It is surrounded by salivary glands. The secretion of saliva contains hirudin which prevents the coagulation of blood. Pharynx leads into crop through a short and narrow oesophagus.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Crop is the largest portion of the alimentary canal. It is divided into a series of 10 chambers. The chambers communicate with one another through circular apertures surrounded by sphincters. A pair of laterals, backwardly directed caecae arises as blind outgrowth from each chamber known as caeca or diverticula. Crop and its diverticula can store large amount of blood which can be slowly digested.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The last chamber of crop opens into stomach. The stomach leads into intestine which is a small straight tube that opens into rectum. The rectum opens to the exterior by anus.</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Food, Feeding and Digestion</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The leech feeds by sucking the blood of cattle and other domestic animals. During feeding the leech attaches itself to its victim strongly by the posterior sucker. The leech makes a triradiate or Y shaped incision in the skin of the host by the jaws protruded through the mouth. The blood is sucked by muscular pharynx and the salivary secretion is poured.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The ingested blood is stored in crop chambers and its diverticulum. The blood passes from the crop into the stomach. Digestion takes place in stomach by the action of proteolytic enzyme. The digested blood is then absorbed slowly by the intestine. Undigested food is stored in rectum and egested through anus.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Leeches prevent blood clotting by secreting a protein called hirudin. They also inject an anaesthetic substance that prevents the host from feeling their bite.</p>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_380">13.1.7Respiratory System</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Respiration takes place through the skin in leech. Dense network of tiny blood vessels called as capillaries containing the haemocoelic fluid extend in between the cells of the epidermis. The exchange of respiratory gases takes place by diffusion. Oxygen dissolved in water diffuses through the skin into haemocoelic fluid, while carbon dioxide diffuses out. The skin is kept moist and slimy due to secretion of mucus which also prevents it from drying.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_381">13.1.8Circulatory System</h3>
	<p class="block_1001">In leech, circulation is brought about by haemocoelic system. There are no true blood vessels. The blood vessels are replaced by channels called haemocoelic channels or canals filled with blood like fluid. The coelomic fluid contains haemoglobin.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">There are four longitudinal channels. One channel lies above (dorsal) the alimentary canal, one below (ventral) the alimentary canal. The other two channels lie on either (lateral) side of the alimentary canal which serve as heart and have inner valves. All the four channels are connected together posteriorly in the 26th segment.</p>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_382">13.1.9Nervous System</h3>
	<p class="block_1001">The central nervous system of leech consists of a nerve ring and a paired ventral nerve cord. The nerve ring surrounds the pharynx and is formed of suprapharyngeal ganglion (brain), circumpharyngeal connective and subpharyngeal ganglion. The subpharyngeal ganglion lies below the pharynx and is formed by the fusion of four pairs of ganglia.</p>

	<p class="block_63">Male Reproductive System</p>
	<p class="block_1054">There are eleven pairs of testes, one pair in each segment from 12 to 22 segments. They are in the form of spherical sacs called testes sacs. From each testis arises a short duct called vas deferens, which join with the vas deferens. The vas deferens becomes convoluted to form the epididymis or sperm vesicle, to store spermatozoa.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The epididymis leads to a short duct called ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory ducts on both sides join to form the genital atrium. The atrium consists of two regions, the coiled prostate glands and the penial sac consisting of penis that opens through the male genital pore.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Female Reproductive System</p>
	<p class="block_1054">It consists of ovaries, oviducts and vagina. There is a single pair of ovaries in the 11th segment on the ventral side. Each ovary is a coiled ribbon-shaped structure.</p>
	<p class="block_">The ova are budded off from the ovary. From each ovary runs a short oviduct. The oviducts of the two sides joins together, to form a common oviduct. The common oviduct opens into a pear-shaped vagina which lies mid-ventrally in the posterior part of the 11th segment.</p>

The colour varies from white to black and white. Body is covered with fur which serves to keep it warm.</p>
	<p class="block_1001"><b class="calibre36">Body-division:</b> The body of the rabbit is divisible into the head, neck, trunk and tail.</p>
	<p class="block_1001"><b class="calibre36">Head:</b> Head is ovoid, flattened and bears a truncate snout. It contains mouth, external nares, eyes, ears and vibrissae. The mouth is a transverse slit-like bounded by upper lip and lower lip. Just above the mouth are two oblique openings called nostrils. From each side of the upper lip tactile hairs or vibrissae (whiskers) project outwards. A pair of large, movable external ear or pinnae is situated at the top of the head.</p>
	<p class="block_1001"><b class="calibre36">Neck:</b> The neck connects the head with the trunk. It helps to turn the head.</p>
	<p class="block_1001"><b class="calibre36">Trunk:</b> The trunk is divisible into an anterior thorax and a posterior abdomen. In females, four or five teats or nipples are present on the ventral surface between the thorax and abdomen.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The trunk bears two pairs of pentadactyl limbs. The forelimbs are shorter than the hind limbs. All the digits bear claws.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The anus is present at the posterior end of the abdomen at the base of tail. In females on the ventral side a slit like vulva is present. In male’s penis is present in the ventral side of anus. The male has a pair of testes enclosed by scrotal sacs.</p>
	<p class="block_1001"><b class="calibre36">Tail:</b> The tail is short. It is used to give signals to other rabbits in the event of danger.</p>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_390">13.2.4Digestive System</h3>
	<p class="block_1001">The digestive system includes the alimentary canal and the associated digestive glands. The alimentary canal consists of mouth, buccal cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, caecum, large intestine and anus.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Mouth is a transverse slit bounded by upper and lower lips. It leads into the buccal cavity. The floor of the buccal cavity is occupied by a muscular tongue. Jaws bear teeth.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The buccal cavity leads into the oesophagus through the pharynx. Oesophagus opens into the stomach followed by small intestine. Caecum is a thin-walled sac present at the junction of small intestine and large intestine. It contains bacteria that helps in digestion of cellulose. The small intestine opens into the large intestine which has colon and rectum. The rectum finally opens outside by the anus.</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Digestive glands</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The digestive glands are salivary glands, gastric glands, liver, pancreas and intestinal glands. The secretions of digestive glands help in digestion of food in the alimentary canal.</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Dentition in Rabbit</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Teeth are hard bone-like structures used to cut, tear and grind the food materials. The rabbit has two sets of teeth. The existence of two sets of teeth in the life of an animal is called diphyodont dentition. The two types of teeth are milk teeth (young ones) and permanent teeth (in adults).</p>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_391">13.2.5Respiratory System</h3>
	<p class="block_1001">Respiration takes place by a pair of lungs, which are light spongy tissues enclosed in the thoracic cavity. The thoracic cavity is bound dorsally by the vertebral column and ventrally by the sternum, laterally by the ribs. On the lower side of the thoracic cavity is the dome shaped diaphragm.</p>
	<p class="block_1001"><img src="images/image-204.png" alt="figure 13.8 Lungs of Rabbit has folllowing parts larynx trachea bronchi right anterior lobe left anterior lobe lobules right posterior lobe left posterior lobe." class="calibre300"/></p>
	<p class="block_1001">Figure. 13.8 Lungs of Rabbit</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Each lung is enclosed by a double membranous pleura. Atmospheric air passes through the external nostril and nasal passages into the pharynx. From the pharynx it passes through the glottis into the windpipe.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The anterior part of the windpipe is enlarged to form the larynx or voice box with its wall supported by four cartilaginous plates. Inside the larynx lies the vocal cord and its vibrations result in the production of sound. The larynx leads into trachea or windpipe.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Tracheal walls are supported by rings of cartilage which help in the free passage of air. The epiglottis prevents the entry of food into the trachea through the glottis. The trachea divides into two branches called the bronchi one entering into each lung and dividing into further branches called bronchioles which end in alveoli.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The respiratory events consist of inspiration (breathing in) and expiration (breathing out) allowing exchange of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide). Inspiration is an active process while expiration is a passive process.</p>

	<p class="block_1054">The heart is four chambered with two auricles and two ventricles. The right and left auricles are separated by interarticular septum, similarly right and left ventricles are separated by interventricular septum.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The right auricle opens into the right ventricle by right auriculoventricular aperture, guarded by a tricuspid valve. The left auricle opens into the left ventricle by left auriculoventricular aperture guarded by a bicuspid valve or mitral valve. The opening of the pulmonary artery and aorta are guarded by three semilunar valves.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The right auricle receives deoxygenated blood through two precaval (superior vena cava) and one postcaval (inferior vena cava) veins from all parts of the body. The left auricle receives oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins from the lungs. From the right ventricle arises pulmonary trunk which carries the deoxygenated blood to the lungs and from the left ventricle arises the systemic arch (aorta) which supplies oxygenated blood to all parts of the body.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_393">13.2.7 Nervous System</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">The nervous system in rabbit is formed of the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system (P N S) and autonomic nervous system (A N S).</p>
	<p class="block_1054">CNS consists of brain and spinal cord. PN S is formed of 12 pairs of cranial nerves and 37 pairs of spinal nerves. A N S comprises sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Brain is situated in the cranial cavity and covered by three membranes called an outer durometer, an inner piamater and a middle arachnoid membrane. The brain is divided into forebrain (prosencephalon), (mesencephalon) and midbrain (rhombencephalon).</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Forebrain consists of a pair of olfactory lobes, cerebral hemispheres and diencephalon. The right and left cerebral hemispheres are connected by transverse band of nerve tissue called corpus callosum.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><img src="images/image-206.png" alt="figure 13.10 Brain of Rabbit (Dorsal view) having following parts olfactory lobe cerebral hemisphere diencephalom optic lobs cerebellum medulla oblongata." class="calibre302"/></p>
	<p class="block_1054">Figure. 13.10 Brain of Rabbit (Dorsal view)</p>
	<p class="block_18"> </p>
	<p class="block_1001">The midbrain includes the optic lobes. The hindbrain consists of the cerebellum, pons varolii and medulla oblongata. You will study about the details of mammalian brain in the chapter on nervous system.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_394">13.2.8Urinogenital System</h3>
	<p class="block_1001">It comprises the urinary or excretory system and the genital or reproductive system. Therefore, they are usually described as urinogenital system in vertebrates.</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Excretory system</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Each kidney is made of several nephrons. It separates the nitrogenous wastes from blood and excretes it in the form of urea. Kidneys are dark red, bean shaped organs situated in the abdominal cavity. From each kidney arises the ureters which open posteriorly into the urinary bladder and leads into a thick-walled muscular duct called urethra.</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Reproductive System</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Sexual dimorphism is exhibited in rabbits. The male and female sexes are separate and are morphologically different.</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Male Reproductive system</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The male reproductive system of rabbit consists of a pair of testes which are ovoid in shape. Testes are enclosed by scrotal sacs in the abdominal cavity. Each testis consists of numerous fine tubules called seminiferous tubules. This network of tubules leads into a coiled tubule called epididymis, which lead into the sperm duct called vas deferens. The vas deferens join in the urethra just below the urinary bladder. The urethra runs backward and passes into the penis.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">There are three accessory glands namely prostate gland, Cowper’s gland and perineal gland. Their secretions are involved in reproduction.</p>
	<p class="block_1001"><img src="images/image-207.png" alt="figure 13.11 Male reproductive system of Rabbit has following parts right kidney left kidney ureter urinary bladder prostate glands cowper's glands perileal glands vas deferens epididymis testis scrotal sac urethra.  " class="calibre303"/></p>
	<p class="block_1002">Fig. 13.11 Male reproductive system of Rabbit</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Female reproductive system</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The female reproductive system of rabbit consists of a pair of ovaries which are small ovoid structures. They are located behind the kidneys in the abdominal cavity.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">A pair of oviducts opens into the body cavity by a funnel shaped opening from each side of the ovary. The anterior part of the oviduct is the fallopian tube. It leads into a wider tube called the uterus. The uterus joins together to form a median tube called vagina. The common tube is formed by the union of urinary bladder and the vagina and is called the urinogenital canal or vestibule. It runs backwards and opens to the exterior by a slit- like aperture called vulva.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">A pair of Cowper’s gland and perineal gland are the accessory glands present in the female reproductive system.</p>
	<p class="block_1001"><img src="images/image-208.png" alt="figure 13.12 reproductive system  of Rabbit  has following parts ovary kidney ureter vagina fallopian tube uterus urinary bladder perineal gland urethra. " class="calibre304"/></p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_407">Introduction</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Multicellular organisms possess millions of cells in their body. Every cell needs a constant supply of essential substances like nutrients and oxygen to maintain life and survival. Food is the only source of energy, and every cell gets its energy by the breakdown of glucose. The cells utilise this energy and govern various vital activities of life.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Have you ever wondered how water and nutrients absorbed by the root are transported to the leaves? How is the food prepared by the leaves carried to the other parts of the plant? Do you know how water reaches the top of tall plants in spite of not having a circulatory system like animals? Water absorbed by the roots have to reach entire plant and the food synthesised by the leaves have to be distributed to all the parts of the plant. To understand this, we need to recall the anatomy of the plants. Water and mineral salts absorbed by the roots reach all parts of the plant through the xylem. The food synthesised by the leaves are translocated to all parts of the plant through the phloem. The bulk movement of substances through the vascular tissue is called Translocation.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">‘Transport’ means to carry things from one place to another. Have you ever wondered how in animals the useful substances are transported to other cells and toxic substances are removed? In larger organism's transport of nutrients, salts, oxygen, hormones and waste products around the body are performed by the ‘Circulatory system’. The circulatory system consists of the circulating fluids, the blood and lymph and the heart and blood vessels which form the collecting and transporting system.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_408">14.1 Means of Transport in Plants</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">The transport of materials in and out of the cells is carried out by diffusion and active transport in plants.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_409">14.1.1 Diffusion</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">The movement of solid, liquid and gaseous molecules from a region of higher concentration to a region of their lower concentration without the utilization of energy is called diffusion. This is a passive process</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Figure 14.1 Diffusion across cell membrane</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><img src="images/image-212.png" alt="C:\Users\ADMIN\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot (231).png" class="calibre308"/></p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_410">14.1.2 Active Transport</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Active transport utilizes energy to pump molecules against a concentration gradient. Active transport is carried out by membrane bound proteins. These proteins use energy to carry substances across the cell membrane hence they are often referred to as pumps. These pumps can transport substances from a low concentration to a high concentration (‘uphill’ transport).</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_411">14.1.3 Osmosis</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Osmosis is the movement of solvent or water molecules from the region of higher concentration to the region of lower concentration through a semi-permeable membrane. This process is carried out till an equilibrium is reached. Osmosis is the passive movement of water or any other solvent molecules.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Plasmolysis</p>
	<p class="block_1054">It occurs when a living plant cell is placed in a hypertonic solution water molecule moves out of the cell and resulting in the shrinkage of protoplasm away from the cell wall.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Figure 14.2 Plasmolysis </p>
	<p class="block_1054"><img src="images/image-213.png" alt="In this image you could see both the Normal Plant cell and Plasmolysed Plant cell." class="calibre309"/></p>
	<p class="block_63">Activity 1</p>
	<p class="block_63">Demonstration of Osmosis</p>
	<p class="block_1054">A thistle funnel whose mouth is covered with a semipermeable membrane, is filled with sucrose solution. It is kept inverted in a beaker containing water. The water will diffuse across the membrane due to osmosis and raise the level of the solution in the funnel.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><img src="images/image-214.png" alt="This picture shows the Demonstration of osmosis where you can see the Sugar solution in the funnel covered with parchment paper is kept inverted in a beaker containing water" class="calibre310"/></p>
	<p class="block_63">Imbibition</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Imbibition is a type of diffusion in which a solid plant material absorbs water and gets swelled up. </p>
	<p class="block_1054">Example absorption of water by dry seeds and grapes. If it were not for imbibition, seedlings would not have been able to emerge out of the soil.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_412">14.2 Root Hair-Water Absorbing Unit</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">There are millions of root hairs on the tip of the root which absorb water and minerals by diffusion. Root hairs are thin walled, slender extension of epidermal cell that increase the surface area of absorption.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Figure 14.3 Root Tip with Root Hairs</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><img src="images/image-215.png" alt="figure 14.3 h Root Hairs - has following parts  region of maturation root hair region of elongation region of meristematic activity root cap. " class="calibre311"/></p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_413">14.3 Pathway of Water Absorbed by Roots</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Once the water enters the root hairs, the concentration of water molecules in the root hair cells become more than that of the cortex. Thus, water from the root hair moves to the cortical cells by osmosis and then reaches the xylem. From there the water is transported to the stem and leaves.</p>
	<p class="block_63"> Figure 14.4 T. S. of the root showing movement of water from soil to xylem</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><img src="images/image-216.png" alt="figure 14.4 T. S. of the root showing movement of water from soil to xylem is as follows  water enter root hair cell then passes through root cortex cell and finally reaches xylem vessels." class="calibre312"/></p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_414">14.4 Types of Movement of Water into the Root Cells</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Once water is absorbed by the root hairs, it can move deeper into root layers by two distinct pathways:</p>
	<ul class="list_4">
	<li class="block_64">Apoplast pathway</li>
	<li class="block_65">Symplast pathway</li>
</ul>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_415">14.4.1 Apoplast Pathway</h3>
	<p class="block_">The apo plastic movement of water occurs exclusively through the intercellular spaces and the walls of the cells. Apo plastic movement does not involve crossing the cell membrane. This movement is dependent on the gradient.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_416">14.4.2 Symplast Pathway</h3>
	<p class="block_">In this method, the water molecules moves to the adjacent cells through the plasma membrane, cytoplasm and </p>
	<p class="block_">Plasmodesmata. This method of transport is slow as water moves through plasma membrane.</p>
	<p class="block_">It is in accordance to the concentration gradient. </p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-217.png" alt="figure 14.5 Symplastic and Apoplastic pathways of Water - important parts are cell wall plasma membrane casparian strip apoplast symplast plasmodesmata endoderm pericycle cells." class="calibre313"/></p>

	<p class="block_1054">Transpiration is the evaporation of water from the aerial parts of the plant through stomata in leaves. Stomata are open in the day and closed at night. The opening and closing of the stomata is due to the change in turgidity of the guard cells. When water enters into the guard cells, they become turgid and the stoma open. When the guard cells lose water, it becomes flaccid and the stoma closes.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Figure. 14.6 Process of Transpiration</p>
	<p class="block_985"><img src="images/image-218.png" alt="Process of Transpiration image where you can see a Small plant in a pot in which the leaves are enclosed in plastic bag. " class="calibre314"/></p>
	<p class="block_1054">Water evaporates from mesophyll cells of leaves through the open stomata, this lowers water concentration in mesophyll cells. As a result, more water is drawn into these cells from the xylem present in the veins through the process of osmosis. As water is lost from the leaves, pressure is created at the top to pull more water from the xylem to the mesophyll cells, this process is called transpiration pull. This extends up to the roots causing the roots to absorb more water from the soil to ensure continuous flow of water from the roots to the leaves.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_418">14.5.1 Factors affecting Transpiration</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Transpiration is affected by several external factors such as temperature, light, humidity, and wind speed. Internal factors that affect transpiration include number and distribution of stomata, percentage of open stomata, water status of the plant, canopy structure etc.</p>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_419">Significance of Transpiration</h3>
	<ul class="list_4">
	<li class="block_64">Creates transpirational pull for transport of water</li>
	<li class="block_1055">Supplies water for photosynthesis</li>
	<li class="block_1055">Transports minerals from soil to all parts of the plant</li>
	<li class="block_1055">Cools the surface of the<span class="tab">      </span>leaves by evaporation.</li>
	<li class="block_8">Keeps the cells turgid; hence, maintains their shape</li>
</ul>
	<p class="block_18"> </p>
	<p class="block_18"> </p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_420">14.6 Root Pressure</h2>
	<p class="block_9">As mineral ions from the soil are actively transported into the xylem tissue of the root, water moves along and increases the pressure inside the xylem. This pressure is called root pressure and is responsible for pushing water upward to some extent</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_421">14.7 Uptake of Minerals</h2>
	<p class="block_1001">Plants depend on minerals from soil for its nutritional requirements. All minerals cannot be passively absorbed by the roots. Two factors account for this: 1 minerals are present in the soil as charged particles (ions) that cannot move across cell membranes and 2 the concentration of minerals in the soil is usually lower than the concentration of minerals in the root. Therefore, most minerals enter the root by active absorption through the cytoplasm of epidermal cells. This needs energy in the form of ATP. Then it is transported to all parts by transpiration pull.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_422">14.8 Translocation of Mineral Ions</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Minerals are remobilised from older dying leaves to younger leaves. This phenomenon can be seen in deciduous plants. Elements like phosphorus, sulphur, nitrogen and potassium are easily mobilised, while elements like calcium are not remobilised. Small amounts of material exchange take place between xylem and phloem.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_423">14.9 Phloem Transport</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">The food synthesised by the leaves are transported by the phloem either to the area of requirement or stored. Phloem tissue is composed of sieve tubes which have sieve plates. Cytoplasmic strands pass through the pores in the sieve plates.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Phloem transports food (sucrose) from a source to a sink. The source is part of the plant that synthesize food, that is the leaf, and sink, is the part that needs or stores the food. But the source and sink may be reversed depending on the season, or the plant’s need.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Since the source-sink relationship is variable, the direction of movement in the phloem can be upwards or downwards, that is, bidirectional. In contrast, the movement is always unidirectional in xylem that is upwards.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_424">14.10 Translocation of Sugars</h2>
	<p class="block_9">The mechanism of translocation of sugars from source to sink is through pressure flow hypothesis Glucose prepared at source (by photosynthesis) is converted to sucrose. Sucrose moves into the companion cells, then into the living phloem sieve tube cells by active transport. This process produces a hypertonic condition in the phloem. Water in the adjacent xylem moves into the phloem by osmosis. As osmotic pressure builds up, the phloem sap moves to areas of lower pressure. By active transport sucrose moves into the cells where it is utilised or stored. As sugars are removed, the osmotic pressure decreases, and water moves out of the phloem.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_425">14.11 Ascent of Sap and its Events – An Overview</h2>
	<p class="block_">The upward movement of water and minerals from roots to different plant parts is called ascent of sap. A number of factors play a role in ascent of sap, and it takes places in following steps</p>
	<p class="block_12">Figure 14.8 Ascent of Sap</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-220.png" alt="figure 14.8 Ascent of Sap -Explained as follows.  osmosis pushes water to root hairs. root pressure pushes water to stem. capillary action results in rise of water at the base of stem. adhesion cohesion makes column of water molecules . transpiration creates transpiration pull." class="calibre316"/></p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">1 Root Pressure:</b> Water from soil enters the root hairs due to osmosis. Root pressure is responsible for movement of water up to the base of the stem.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">2 Capillary Action:</b> Water or any liquid rises in a capillary tube because of physical forces, this phenomenon is called capillary action. In the same way, in stem water rises up to certain height because of capillary action.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">3 Adhesion-cohesion of Water Molecules: </b>Water molecules form a continuous column in the xylem because of forces of adhesion and cohesion among the molecules.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">4 Cohesion:</b> The force of attraction between molecules of water is called cohesion.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">5 Adhesion:</b> The force of attraction between molecules of different substances is called adhesion. Water molecules stick to a xylem because of force of adhesion.</p>
	<p class="block_12">More to Know</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Dews are water droplets on the leaves of grass seen in the early mornings, when the climate is humid and excess of water is present in the plants, the excess water is exudated in the form of liquid. This is due to root pressure. This phenomenon is called Guttation which takes place through specialized cells called Hydathodes.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Transpiration Pull:</b> Transpiration through stomata creates vacuum which creates a suction. called transpiration pull. The transpiration pull sucks the water column from the xylem tubes and thus water is able to rise to great heights even in the tallest plants.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Activity 2</p>
	<p class="block_63">Demonstration of Root Pressure</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Choose a small soft stemmed plant. Cut the stem horizontally near the base with a blade in the morning. You will see drops of solution oozing out of the cut stem due to root pressure.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_426">14.12 Blood</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Blood is the main circulatory medium in the human body. It is a red coloured fluid connective tissue.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Components of Blood:</b> The blood consists of two main components. The fluid plasma and the formed elements (blood cells) which are found suspended in the plasma.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Plasma:</b> It is slightly alkaline, containing non-cellular substance which constitutes about 55% of the blood. Organic substances like proteins, glucose, urea, enzymes, hormones, vitamins and minerals are present in the plasma.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Formed Elements of Blood</b>: Blood corpuscles are of three types</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">(1). Red blood corpuscles</b> (RBC) or Erythrocytes</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6"><span class="calibre28">(2).  White blood corpuscles</span></b> (WBC) or Leucocytes</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6"><span class="calibre28">(3).  Blood platelets</span></b> or Thrombocytes.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Red blood corpuscles (Erythrocytes)</p>
	<p class="block_1054">They are the most abundant cells in the human body. RBCs are formed in the bone marrow. The RBCs impart<span class="tab">      </span>red colour to the blood due to presence of respiratory pigment haemoglobin. Matured mammalian RBCs do not have cell organelles and nucleus. They are biconcave and disc shaped. Their life span is about 120 days. RBC is involved in the transport of oxygen from lungs to tissues.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Erythrocytes</p>
	<p class="block_985"><img src="images/image-221.png" alt="Image displays Erythrocytes" class="calibre317"/></p>
	<p class="block_12">Do You Know</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Why does mammalian RBC lack cell organelles and nucleus?</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Mammalian RBC lack nucleus and makes the cells biconcave and increase surface area for oxygen binding, loss of mitochondria allows the RBC to transport all the oxygen to tissues, and loss of endoplasmic reticulum allows more flexibility for RBC to move through the narrow capillaries.</p>
	<p class="block_63">White blood corpuscles (Leucocytes)</p>
	<p class="block_1054">WBCs are colourless. They do not have haemoglobin and are nucleated cells. It is found in the bone marrow, spleen, thymus and lymph nodes. They are capable of amoeboid movement</p>

	<p class="block_1002">Closed type</p>
	<p class="block_1001">In closed type the blood flows in a complete circuit around the body through specific blood vessels. The blood flows from arteries to veins through small blood vessels called capillaries.</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_429">14.15 Structure of Human Heart</h2>
	<p class="block_1001">Heart is a muscular pumping organ that pumps out the blood into the blood vessels. Human heart is situated between the lungs, slightly tilted toward the left and above the diaphragm in the thoracic cavity. The heart is made of specialized type of muscle called the cardiac muscle.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The heart is enclosed in a double walled sac called pericardium. It contains lubricating pericardial fluid which reduces friction during heartbeat and protects it from mechanical injuries.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Figure 14.11 External structure of human heart</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-224.png" alt="Image displays the External structure of human heart  where you can see Superior vernacava, Right attrium, Right Ventricle, Inferior Vernacava, Aorta, Pulmonary trunk, Left attrium, Pulmonary veins and Left Ventricle." class="calibre321"/></p>
	<p class="block_1054">The human heart is four chambered. The two upper thin-walled chambers of the heart are called auricle or atria (sing: atrium) and two lower thick-walled chambers are called ventricles. The chambers are separated by partition called septum. The septum between auricles and ventricles prevents the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The two auricles are separated from each other by interatrial septum. The left atrium is smaller than the right atrium. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from different parts of the body through the main vein’s superior vena cava, inferior vena cava and coronary sinus. Pulmonary veins bring oxygenated blood to the left atrium from the lungs. The right and left auricles pump blood into the right and left ventricles respectively.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The ventricles form the lower part of the heart. The two ventricles are separated from each other by an interventricular septum. The left and right ventricles have thick walls because the ventricles have to pump out blood with force away from the heart. From the right ventricle arises the pulmonary trunk which bifurcates to form right and left pulmonary arteries. The right and left pulmonary arteries supply deoxygenated blood to the lungs of the respective side. The left ventricle is longer and narrower than the right ventricle. The walls are about three times thicker than the right ventricle. The left ventricle gives rise to aorta. The oxygenated blood is supplied by the aorta to various organs of the body. The coronary arteries supply blood to the heart.</p>

	<ol class="list_1">
	<li class="block_1049"><b class="calibre36">Systemic circulation:</b> Circulation of oxygenated blood from the left ventricle of the heart to various organs of the body and return of deoxygenated blood to the right atrium. Aorta carries oxygenated blood to all the organs of the body.</li>
	<li class="block_1049"><b class="calibre36">Pulmonary circulation:</b> The path of pulmonary circulation starts in the right ventricle. Pulmonary artery arises from the right ventricle and reaches the lungs with deoxygenated blood. Pulmonary veins collect the oxygenated blood from the lungs and supplies it to the left atrium of the heart.</li>
	<li class="block_1049"><b class="calibre36">Coronary circulation:</b> The supply of blood to the heart muscles (cardiac muscles) is called as coronary circulation. Cardiac muscles receive oxygenated blood from coronary arteries that originate from the aortic arch. Deoxygenated blood from the cardiac muscles drains into the right atrium by the coronary sinuses.</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_1001">When the blood circulates twice through the heart in one complete cycle it is called double circulation. In double circulation the oxygenated blood do not mix with the deoxygenated blood.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">However, in some animals the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are mixed and pass through the heart only once. This type of circulation is called single circulation. Example  fishes, amphibians and certain reptiles.</p>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_431">14.15.2 Heartbeat</h3>
	<p class="block_1001">One complete contraction (systole) and relaxation (diastole) of the atrium and ventricles of the heart constitute heartbeat. The heart normally beats 72 – 75 times per minute.</p>
	<p class="block_12">More to Know</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Neurogenic and Myogenic Heartbeat</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Neurogenic heartbeat is initiated by a nerve impulse caused from a nerve ganglion situated near the heart. Example Annelids, most arthropods</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Myogenic heartbeat is initiated by a specialized group of modified heart muscle fibres. example Mollusca and Vertebrates</p>
	<p class="block_63">Initiation and conduction of Heartbeat</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The human heart is myogenic in nature. Contraction is initiated by a specialized portion of the heart muscle, the Sino-atrial (S A) node which is situated in the wall of the right atrium near the opening of the superior vena cava. The S A node is broader at the top and tapering below. It is made up of thin fibres.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Sino-atrial node acts as the ‘pacemaker’ of the heart because it is capable of initiating impulse which can stimulate the heart muscles to contract. The impulse from the sinoatrial node spreads as a wave of contraction over the right and left atrial wall pushing the blood through the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles. The wave of contraction from S A node reaches the atrioventricular (AV) node which is stimulated to emit an impulse of contraction spreading to the ventricular muscle via the atrioventricular bundle and the Purkinje fibres.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Do You Know</p>
	<p class="block_">Atrioventricular bundle was discovered by His (1893). So is called Bundle of His.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Pulse:</b> When the heart beats the blood is forced into the arteries. The expansion of the artery every time the blood is forced into it is called pulse. It can be felt by placing the fingertip on the artery near the wrist. Normal pulse rate ranges from 70 – 90 PER minute.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Activity 3 </b>Determining Heart Rate</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Materials:</p>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_432">14.15.3 Cardiac Cycle</h3>
	<p class="block_">The sequence of events occurring from the beginning to the completion of one heartbeat is called cardiac cycle. During cardiac cycle blood flows through the chambers of the heart in a specific direction. Each cardiac cycle lasts about 0.8 second. The event during a single cardiac cycle involves</p>
	<ol class="list_2">
	<li class="block_6"><b class="calibre6">Atrial systole:</b> Contraction of auricles (0.1 second).</li>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_433">14.15.4 Heart Sound</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">The rhythmic closure and opening of the valves cause the sound of the heart. </p>
	<p class="block_1054">The first sound L U B B is of longer duration and is produced by the closure of the tricuspid and bicuspid valves after the beginning of ventricular systole. The second sound D U P P is of a shorter duration and produced by the closure of semilunar valves at the end of ventricular systole.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_434">14.16 Blood pressure</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Blood pressure is the force exerted during the flow of blood against the lateral walls of arteries. The blood pressure is high in the arteries gradually drops in the arterioles and capillaries and become very low in the veins.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure and diastolic pressure.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Systolic pressure:</b> During ventricular systole, the left ventricle contracts and forces blood into the aorta. The pressure rises to a peak which is referred as systolic pressure.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Diastolic pressure:</b> During diastole, the ventricles relax, and the pressure falls to the lowest value which is referred as diastolic pressure.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">In a healthy adult during normal resting condition systolic and diastolic blood pressure is expressed as 120mm by 80mm Hg. Blood pressure varies during conditions of physical exercise, anxiety, emotions, stress and sleep.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">A prolonged or constant elevation of blood pressure is a condition known as hypertension (High blood pressure) can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Decrease in blood pressure is termed hypotension (Low blood pressure).</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_435">Stethoscope</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">A stethoscope is used to detect the sound produced by the internal organs of human body. The heart sound is heard by placing the stethoscope on the chest. It is a useful diagnostic tool to identify and localize health problems and diagnose disease. The modern electronic stethoscopes are high previsioned instruments.</p>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_436">Sphygmomanometer</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Sphygmomanometer is a clinical instrument used to measure blood pressure when a person is in a relaxed and resting condition. The pressure of the brachial artery is measured. It helps to estimate the state of blood circulation and the working of the heart. It helps to diagnose conditions such as increased or decreased blood pressure. Manometric and modern digital types are the apparatus used to measure blood pressure.</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_437">14.17 Blood Groups</h2>
	<p class="block_1054"><span class="calibre28">The concept of blood grouping was developed by Karl Landsteiner (1900). He identified blood groups A, B and O. AB blood group was recognized by Decastello and Steini (19 02).Human blood contains certain specific substances called agglutinogens or antigens (Ag) and agglutinins or antibodies (A b). Antigens are found on the membrane surface of RBC. Antibodies are present in blood plasma. Based on the presence or absence of antigen and antibodies human blood group is classified into four groups called,  A, B, A B and O. An individual has one of the four blood groups.</span></p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li class="block_64">‘A’group individuals: Antigen A is present on the surface of RBC and antibody b (anti-b) is present in the plasma.</li>
	<li class="block_1055">‘B’group individuals: Antigen B is present on the surface of RBC and antibody a (anti - a) is present in the plasma.</li>
	<li class="block_1055"><span class="calibre28">‘A  B’  group individuals: Antigens A and B are present on the surface of RBC and both the antibodies are absent in the plasma.</span></li>
	<li class="block_65">‘O’group individuals: Antigen A or B are absent on the surface of RBC. However, the plasma contains both the antibodies a and b (anti a and b).</li>
</ol>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_438">Blood donation</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">In blood transfusion one must consider the antigen and antibody compatibility (matching) between the donor and the person receiving blood (recipient). When an individual receives a mismatched blood group from the donor agglutination (clumping) of blood occurs in the body which leads to death.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><span class="calibre28"> Persons with ‘A B’  blood group are called ‘Universal Recipient’ as they can receive blood from persons with any blood group.</span></p>
	<p class="block_1054"><span class="calibre28">Persons with ‘O’  blood group are called ‘Universal Donor’ as they can donate blood to persons with any blood group.</span></p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_439">Rh factor</h3>
	<p class="block_1001">Rh factor was discovered by Landsteiner and Wiener in 1940 in Rhesus monkey. The surface of RBC contains the antigen for Rh factor. Rh+ ( positive) persons have Rh antigen on the surface of RBC while, Rh minus (negative)persons do not have Rh antigen on the surface of RBC. Antibodies developed against this Rh antigen is called Rh antibodies.</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_464">Introduction</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">One of the characteristic features of all living organisms is responding to stimuli. Stimulus refers to the changes in the environmental condition, that are detected by receptors present in the body. Relevant changes in the activities of organisms to particular stimuli are called their reactions or responses. Living organisms show their response to different kinds of stimuli like light, heat, cold, sound, smell, taste, touch, pressure, pain or the force of gravity etc. For example, withdrawal of hand when we touch hot objects or closing the eyes when flashed with bright light, in this condition heat or light is the stimulus to which the body shows its response. Thus, on receiving a stimulus, the body responds in a manner that is most appropriate for its survival and functioning. </p>
	<p class="block_1054">To provide the correct response to a stimulus, it is necessary that all the organs work together in a proper coordinated manner. This working together of various organs in a systematic, controlled and efficient way to produce proper response to various stimuli is called coordination. In animals including human the coordination between the various cells and organs is essential for their diverse activities to maintain physiological balance called homeostasis. In this unit we shall learn about one of the major regulatory systems the nervous system and its control over the body activities</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_465">15.1 Nervous System</h2>
	<p class="block_1001">The nervous system is made up of nervous tissues. It is formed of three distinct components namely the neurons, neuroglia and nerve fibres.</p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li class="block_1049"><b class="calibre36">Neuron or nerve cell:</b> A neuron or nerve cell is the structural and functional unit of the nervous system. It is the longest cell of the human body with a length of over 100 mew m. These cells are highly specialised to detect, receive and transmit different kinds of stimuli. Information is conducted through neurons in the form of electrical impulses from one part of the body to another.</li>
	<li class="block_1049"><b class="calibre36">Neuroglia:</b> Neuroglia are also called as glial cells. They are non-exciting, supporting cell of the nervous system. They do not initiate or conduct nerve impulses.</li>
	<li class="block_1049"><b class="calibre36">Nerve fibres:</b> The nerve fibres are the long slender processes of neurons. A number of nerve fibres are bundled up together to form nerves.</li>
</ol>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_466">15.1.1 Structure of Neuron</h3>
	<p class="block_">A neuron typically consists of three basic parts: Cyton, Dendrites and Axon.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Fig. 15.1 Structure of Neuron</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-237.png" alt="Image displays the Picture of Neuro where ther following items are highlighted.  1. Dendrites 2. Nucleus 3. Axon 4. Cyton 5. Nodes of Ranvier 6. Myelin sheath 7. Axon terminal" class="calibre335"/></p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li class="block_64"><b class="calibre6">Cyton: </b>Cyton is also called cell body or perikaryon. It has a central nucleus with abundant cytoplasm called neoplasm. The cytoplasm has large granular body called Nissl’s granules and the other cell organelles like mitochondria, ribosomes, lysosomes, and endoplasmic reticulum. Neurons do not have the ability to divide. Several neurofibrils are present in the cytoplasm that help in transmission of nerve impulses to and from the cell body.</li>
	<li class="block_1055"><b class="calibre6">Dendrites</b>: These are the numerous branched cytoplasmic processes that project from the surface of the cell body. They conduct nerve impulses towards the cyton. The branched projections increase the surface area for receiving the signals from other nerve cells.</li>
	<li class="block_65"><b class="calibre6">Axon:</b> The axon is a single, elongated, slender projection. The end of axon terminates as fine branches which terminate into knob like swellings called synaptic knob. The plasma membrane of axon is called axolemma, while the cytoplasm is called axoplasm. It carries impulses away from the cyton. The axons may be covered by a protective sheath called myelin sheath which is further covered by a layer of Schwann cells called neurilemma. Myelin sheath breaks at intervals by depressions called Nodes of Ranvier. The region between the nodes is called as internode. Myelin sheath acts as insulator and ensures rapid transmission of nerve impulses.</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Synapse:</b> A junction between synaptic knob of axon of one neuron and dendron of next neuron is called synaptic junction. Information from one neuron can pass to another neuron through these junctions with the release of chemicals known as neurotransmitters from the synaptic knob.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Activity 1</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Create a model of a neuron using clay or beads.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_467">15.1.2 Types of Neurons</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">The neurons may be of different types based on their structure and functions.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><img src="images/image-238.png" alt="Picture shows the image of Unipolar, Bipolar and multipolar neurons." class="calibre336"/></p>
	<p class="block_63">Fig. 15.2 Unipolar (A), Bipolar (B) and multipolar (C) neurons</p>
	<p class="block_9">Structurally the neurons may be of the following types:</p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li class="block_66"><b class="calibre36">Unipolar neurons:</b> Only one nerve process arises from the cyton which acts as both axon and dendron.</li>
	<li class="block_66"><b class="calibre36">Bipolar neurons:</b> The cyton gives rise to two nerve processes of which one acts as an axon while another as a dendron.</li>
	<li class="block_66"><b class="calibre36">Multipolar neurons:</b> The cyton gives rise to many dendrons and an axon.</li>

	<p class="block_18"> </p>
	<p class="block_1054">On the basis of functions neurons are categorised as: -</p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li class="block_64"><b class="calibre6">Sensory or afferent neurons</b> which carry impulses from the sense organ to the central nervous system.</li>
	<li class="block_1055"><b class="calibre6">Motor or efferent neurons</b> which carry impulses from the central nervous system to effector organ such as the muscle fibre or the gland.</li>
	<li class="block_65"><b class="calibre6">Association neurons</b> conduct impulses between sensory and motor neurons.</li>
</ol>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_468">15.1.3 Types of Nerve Fibres</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Nerve fibres are of two types based on the presence or absence of myelin sheath.</p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li class="block_64"><b class="calibre6">Myelinated nerve fibre:</b> The axon is covered with myelin sheath</li>
	<li class="block_65"><b class="calibre6">Non-myelinated nerve fibre:</b> The axon is not covered by myelin sheath.</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_1054">Myelinated and non-myelinated nerve fibres form the white matter and grey matter of the brain.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_469">15.2 Transmission of Nerve Impulse</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">All the information from the environment is detected by the receptors located in our sense organs such as the eyes, the nose, the skin etcetera. Information from the receptors is transmitted as electrical impulse and is received by the dendritic tips of the neuron. This impulse travels from the dendrite to the cell body and then along the axon to its terminal end. On reaching the axonal end, it causes the nerve endings to release a chemical (neurotransmitter) which diffuses across a synapse and starts a similar electrical impulse in the dendrites of the next neuron, then to their cell body to be carried along the axon.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">In this way, the electrical signal reaches the brain or spinal cord. The response from brain (or spinal cord) is similarly passed on to the effector organs such as the muscle or gland cell, that undergoes the desired response.</p>
	<p class="block_9"><img src="images/image255.jpeg" alt="Nerve impulse transmission in Explained " class="calibre337"/></p>
	<p class="block_19">Fig. 15.3 Nerve impulse transmission</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The flow of nerve impulses from axonal end of one neuron to dendrite of another neuron through a synapse is called synaptic transmission.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Do You Know?</p>
	<p class="block_">Each neuron can transmit 1,000 nerve impulses per second and make as many as ten thousand of synaptic contacts with other neurons.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_470">15.2.1 Neurotransmitters</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Neurotransmitters are the chemicals which allow the transmission of nerve impulse from the axon terminal of one neuron to the dendron of another neuron or to an effector organ. The important neurotransmitter released by neurons is called Acetylcholine.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_471">15.3 Human Nervous System</h2>
	<p class="block_1001">The complexity of nervous system can be observed during the course of evolution. We the human beings differ from other animals in our ability to think and take actions, which is due to the well-developed nervous system. Human nervous system is differentiated into central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system (PN S) and autonomic nervous system (A N S).</p>
	<p class="block_18"> </p>
	<p class="block_1001">The CNS acts as centre for information processing and control. It consists of the brain and the spinal cord. The PN S is made up of the nerves which connect the brain and spinal cord to all parts of the body. The A N S is formed of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_472">15.3.1 Central Nervous System</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">The brain and the spinal cord being delicate vital structures are well protected in bony cavities of the skull and the vertebral column respectively. CNS is formed of two types of matter such as white matter or grey matter with respect to the presence or absence of myelin sheath which we have discussed earlier.</p>

	<p class="block_18"> </p>
	<p class="block_18"> </p>
	<p class="block_1001">The brain is the controlling centre of all the body activities. It is covered by three connectives </p>
	<p class="block_1001">tissue membrane or meninges:</p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li class="block_1142"><b class="calibre36">Durometer</b> (dura: tough; mater: membrane) is the outermost thick fibrous membrane</li>
	<li class="block_1142"><b class="calibre36">Arachnoid membrane</b> (arachnoid: spider) is the middle, thin vascular membrane providing web like cushion</li>
	<li class="block_1142"><b class="calibre36">Piamater</b> (Pia: soft or tender) is the innermost, thin delicate membrane richly supplied with blood.</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_1001">Meningeal membranes protect the brain from mechanical injury.</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Do You Know?</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges. It can occur when fluid surrounding the meninges becomes infected. The most common causes of meningitis are viral and bacterial infections.</p>
	<p class="block_9">A human brain is formed of three main parts: (a) forebrain (b) midbrain and (c) hindbrain.</p>
	<p class="block_9"><img src="images/image-240.png" alt="Image displays Structure of Brain " class="calibre339"/></p>
	<p class="block_1001"><b class="calibre36">Forebrai</b>n: The forebrain is formed of cerebrum and diencephalon. The latter consists of dorsal thalamus and ventral hypothalamus.</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Cerebrum</p>
	<p class="block_1001">It is the largest portion forming nearly two- third of the brain. The cerebrum is longitudinally divided into two halves as right and left cerebral hemispheres by a deep cleft called median cleft. Two cerebral hemispheres are interconnected by thick band of nerve fibres called corpus callosum. The outer portion of each cerebral hemisphere is formed of grey matter and is called cerebral cortex. The inner or deeper part is formed of white matter and is called cerebral medulla. The cortex is extremely folded forming elevations called gyri with depressions between them termed as sulci that increase its surface area.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Each cerebral hemisphere is divisible into a frontal lobe, a parietal lobe, a temporal lobe and an occipital lobe. These lobes are also known as cerebral lobes and are associated with specific functions. Any damage in specific lobe intern affects its function.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The cerebrum is responsible for the thinking, intelligence, consciousness, memory, imagination, reasoning and willpower.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Thalamus</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Thalamus present in cerebral medulla is a major conducting centre for sensory and motor signalling. It acts as a relay centre.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Hypothalamus</p>
	<p class="block_1054">It lies at the base of the thalamus. It controls involuntary functions like hunger, thirst, sleep, sweating, sexual desire, anger, fear, water balance, blood pressure etcetera. It acts as a thermoregulatory (temperature control) center of the body. It controls the secretion of hormones from anterior pituitary gland and is an important link between nervous system and endocrine system.</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Midbrain</p>
	<p class="block_1001">It is located between thalamus and hind brain. The dorsal portion of the mid brain consists of four rounded bodies called corpora quadrigemina that control visual and auditory (hearing) reflexes.</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Hindbrain</p>
	<p class="block_1001">It is formed of three parts cerebellum, pons and medulla oblongata.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Do You Know?</p>
	<p class="block_1054">That human brain constitutes nearly 60 percent of fat. The most crucial molecules that determine our brain’s integrity and the ability are Essential Fatty Acids (EFA s). EFA s cannot be synthesised and must be obtained from food. Fish, green leafy vegetables, almond, walnut are rich sources of EFA s.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Cerebellum</p>
	<p class="block_1054">It is second largest part of the brain formed of two large sized hemispheres and middle vermis. It coordinates voluntary movements and also maintains body balance.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Pons</p>
	<p class="block_1054">‘Pons’ a Latin word meaning bridge. It is a bridge of nerve fibre that connects the lobes of cerebellum. It relays signals between the cerebellum, spinal cord, midbrain and cerebrum. It controls respiration and sleep cycle.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Medulla Oblongata</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Medulla oblongata is the posterior most part of the brain that connects spinal cord and various parts of brain. It has cardiac centres, respiratory centres, vasomotor centres to control heartbeat, respiration and contractions of blood vessels respectively. It also regulates vomiting and salivation.</p>

	<p class="block_1054"><span class="calibre28">Electroencephalogram (E E G) is an instrument which records the electrical impulses of   brain. </span></p>
	<p class="block_1054">An E E G can detect abnormalities in the brain waves and help in diagnoses of seizures, epilepsy, brain tumours, head injuries, etcetera.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Spinal Cord</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Spinal cord is a cylindrical structure lying in the neural canal of the vertebral column. It is also covered by meninges. It extends from the lower end of medulla oblongata to the first lumbar vertebra. The posterior most region of spinal cord tapers into a thin fibrous thread like structure called filum terminal.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Internally, the spinal cord contains a cerebrospinal fluid filled cavity known as the central canal. The grey matter of spinal cord is ‘H’ shaped. The upper end of letter ‘H” forms posterior horns and lower end forms anterior horns. A bundle of fibres passes into the posterior horn forming dorsal or afferent root. Fibres pass outward from the anterior horn forming ventral or efferent root. These two <span id="id_Int_xz99chIq">roots join to form spinal nerves. The white matter is external and have bundle of nerve tracts. Spinal cord conducts sensory and motor impulses to and from the brain. It controls reflex actions of the body.</span></p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_473">15.4 Cerebrospinal Fluid</h2>
	<p class="block_">The brain is suspended in a special fluid environment called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is lymph like, watery fluid that surrounds and protects the brain within the skull. It also fills the central canal of the spinal cord.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Functions:</p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li class="block_6">It acts as shock absorbing fluid and protects the brain from damage when it is subjected to sudden jerk.</li>
	<li class="block_7">It supplies nutrients to the brain.</li>
	<li class="block_7">It collects and removes wastes from the brain.</li>
	<li class="block_8">It is also responsible for maintaining a constant pressure inside the cranium.</li>
</ol>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_474">15.5 Reflex Action</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">A reflex is any response that occurs automatically without consciousness. There are two types of reflexes.</p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li class="block_64"><b class="calibre6">Simple or basic reflexes:</b> These reflexes are inbuilt and unlearned responses. Many of the actions we perform in our day-to-day life are simple reflexes. e.g., winking of eyes when any dust particles enter, sneezing, coughing, yawning, etc. We perform these actions without thinking.</li>
	<li class="block_65"><b class="calibre6">Acquired or conditioned reflexes: These</b> reflexes are the result of practice and learning. Playing harmonium by striking a particular key on seeing a music note is an example of conditioned reflexes which required conscious training effort. Can you think of some more examples of conditioned reflexes?</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_1054">Most of the reflex actions are monitored and controlled by the spinal cord, hence also known as spinal reflexes.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The pathway taken by nerve impulse to accomplish reflex action is called reflex arc. Now, let us understand how the body executes reflex action when we touch a hot plate.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><img src="images/image-242.png" alt="Picture shows the image of Reflex action and its pathway" class="calibre341"/></p>
	<p class="block_1054">Fig. 15.7 Reflex action and its pathway</p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li class="block_1150">When we touch a very hot pan, the stimulus is the heat which is sensed by receptor called as heat receptors or thermoreceptors in our hand. This stimulus (heat) intern triggers an impulse in sensory neuron.</li>
	<li class="block_1049">The sensory neuron transmits or conveys the message to the spinal cord.</li>
	<li class="block_1049">Spinal cord interprets the stimulus, and the impulse is passed on to the relay neuron which intern transmits it to a motor neuron.</li>
	<li class="block_1049">Motor neurons carry command from spinal cord to our arm.</li>
	<li class="block_1049">Muscle in our arm contracts and we withdraw our hand immediately from the pan.</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_1001">In this example, muscle is an effector organ which has responded to the heat. You will study in higher classes how the neuronal impulse triggers the muscular movement.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_475">15.6 Peripheral Nervous System</h2>
	<p class="block_1001">Peripheral nervous system is formed by the nerves arising from the brain and the spinal cord. The nerves arising from the brain are called cranial nerves. Nerves arising from spinal cord are called spinal nerves.</p>

	<p class="block_63">Cranial Nerves</p>
	<p class="block_1054">In man, there are 12 pairs of cranial nerves. Some of the cranial nerves are sensory example optic nerve which innervates the eye. Some are motor nerves which helps in rotation of eyeball. It also innervates the eye muscles, muscles of iris and tear gland.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Spinal Nerves</p>
	<p class="block_1054">There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves. Each spinal nerve has a dorsal sensory root and the ventral motor root. The direction of impulses in dorsal spinal root is towards the spinal cord and in ventral spinal root away from the spinal cord.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_476">15.7 Autonomic Nervous System</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Autonomic nervous system (A N S) is also called as visceral nervous system as it regulates the function of internal visceral organs of our body through its two antagonistic (opposite) components sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. They enable the body to perform rapid and specific visceral activities in order to maintain steady state. It controls the involuntary functions of the visceral organs.</p>

	<p class="block_1001">The word hormone is derived from the Greek word “hormon” meaning “to excite”. The function of control and coordination in plants is performed by chemical substances produced by the plants called plant hormones. In plants several cells are capable of producing hormones. These phytohormones are transported to different parts of the plants to perform various physiological functions.</p>
	<p class="block_1001"><b class="calibre36">Endocrine glands</b> in vertebrate animals possess a diversified communication system to co-ordinate physiological and metabolic functions by chemical integration. The endocrine system acts through chemical messengers known as hormones which are produced by specialized glands. Physiological processes such as digestion, metabolism, growth, development and reproduction are controlled by hormones. </p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_491">16.1 Plant Hormones</h2>
	<p class="block_1001">Plant hormones are organic molecules that are produced at extremely low concentration in plants. These molecules control morphological, physiological and biochemical responses.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Types of Plant Hormones </p>
	<p class="block_1001">There are five major classes of plant hormones.</p>
	<p class="block_19"><img src="images/image-248.png" alt="A QR code is given with a code of OWJBT" class="calibre347"/></p>
	<p class="block_19">They are:</p>

	<li class="block_1164">Cytokinin’s</li>
	<li class="block_1164">Gibberellins</li>
	<li class="block_1164">Abscisic Acid (A B A)</li>
	<li class="block_1164">Ethylene</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_9">Among all these plant hormones auxins, cytokinin’s and gibberellins promote plant growth while abscisic acid and ethylene inhibit plant growth.</p>

	<p class="block_19">Figure 16.1 Hormonal interaction in plant growth and development</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_492">16.1.1 Auxins</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Auxins (G k. auxin = to grow) were the first plant hormones discovered. The term auxin was introduced by Kogl and Haagen- Smith (1931). Auxins are produced at the tip of stems and roots from where they migrate to the zone of elongation. Charles Darwin in 1880 observed unilateral growth and curvature of canary grass (Phalariscanariensis) coleoptiles. He came to the conclusion that some ‘influence’ was transmitted from the tip of the coleoptile to the basal region. This ‘influence’ was later identified as Auxin by Went.</p>
	<h4 class="block_103">16.1.1.1 Went’s Experiment</h4>
	<p class="block_1054">Frits Warmolt Went (1903 to 1990), a Dutch biologist demonstrated the existence and effect of auxin in plants. He did a series of experiments in Avena coleoptiles.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">In his first experiment he removed the tips of Avena coleoptiles. The cut tips did not grow indicating that the tips produced something essential for growth. In his second experiment he placed the agar blocks on the decapitated coleoptile tips. The coleoptile tips did not show any response. In his next experiment he placed the detached coleoptile tips on agar blocks. After an hour, he discarded the tips and placed this agar block on the decapitated coleoptile. It grew straight up indicating that some chemical had diffused from the cut coleoptile tips into the agar block which stimulated the growth.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">From his experiments Went concluded that a chemical diffusing from the tip of coleoptiles was responsible for growth, and he named it as “Auxin” meaning ‘to grow”.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><img src="images/image-250.png" alt="Image displays the Wents experiment, where you can see,  a) Germination of an Oat seed, b) Decapitate tip of coleoptile and place on agar block  c) Agar block is placed on top of the decapitated tip of the seeding. " class="calibre349"/></p>
	<p class="block_12">Figure 16.2 Went’s Experiment</p>
	<p class="block_12">Types of Auxins: Auxins are classified into two types, namely natural auxins and synthetic auxins.</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_1165">Natural Auxins: Auxins produced by the plants are called natural auxins. Example: IAA (Indole – 3 - Acetic Acid)</li>
	<li class="block_1166">Synthetic Auxins: Artificially synthesized auxins that have properties like auxins are called as synthetic auxins. Example: 2, 4 D (2,4 Dichloro phenoxy Acetic Acid).</li>

	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_1165">Auxins promote the elongation of stems and coleoptiles which makes them to grow.</li>
	<li class="block_1167">Auxins induce root formation at low concentration and inhibit it at higher concentration.</li>
	<li class="block_1167">The auxins produced by the apical buds suppress growth of lateral buds. This is called apical dominance.</li>
	<li class="block_1167">Seedless fruits without fertilization are induced by the external application of auxins. (Parthenocarpy). Examples: Watermelon, Grapes, Lime etcetera.</li>
	<li class="block_1166">Auxins prevent the formation of abscission layer.</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_">Do You Know </p>
	<p class="block_">Phenyl Acetic Acid (P A A) and Indole 3 Acetonitrile (I A N) are natural auxins. Indole 3 Butyric Acid (I B A), Indole-3- Propionic Acid, α-Naphthalene Acetic Acid (N A A), 2, 4, 5-T (2,4,5 Trichloro phenoxy Acetic Acid) are some of the synthetic auxins.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_493">16.1.2 Cytokinin’s</h3>
	<p class="block_">Cytokinin’s (Cyrtos - cell; kinesis - division) are the plant hormones that promote cell division or cytokinesis in plant cells. It was first isolated from Herring fish sperm. Zeatin was the cytokinin isolated from Zea mays. Cytokinin is found abundantly in liquid endosperm of coconut.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Physiological effects of cytokinin’s</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_1049">Cytokinin induces cell division(cytokinesis) in the presence of auxins.</li>
	<li class="block_1049">Cytokinin also causes cell enlargement.</li>
	<li class="block_1049">Both auxins and cytokinin’s are essential for the formation of new organs from the callus in tissue culture (Morphogenesis).</li>
	<li class="block_1049">Cytokinin’s promote the growth of lateral buds even in the presence of apical bud.</li>
	<li class="block_1049">Application of cytokinin delays the process of ageing in plants. This is called Richmond Lang effect.</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_1006"> </p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_494">16.1.3 Gibberellins</h3>
	<p class="block_1001">Gibberellins are the most abundantly found plant hormones. Kurosawa (1926) observed Bakanae disease or foolish seedling disease in rice crops. This internodal elongation in rice was caused by fungus Gibberellafujikuroi. The active substance was identified as Gibberellic acid.</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Physiological effects of gibberellins</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_1168">Application of gibberellins on plants stimulate extraordinary elongation of internode. e.g., Corn and Pea.</li>
	<li class="block_1165">Treatment of rosette plants with gibberellin induces sudden shoot elongation followed by flowering. This is called bolting.</li>
	<li class="block_1167">Gibberellins promote the production of male flowers in monoecious plants (Cucurbits).</li>
	<li class="block_1167">Gibberellins break dormancy of potato tubers.</li>
	<li class="block_1166">Gibberellins are efficient than auxins in inducing the formation of seedless fruit - Parthenocarpic fruits (Development of fruits without fertilization) e.g., Tomato.</li>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_495">16.1.4 Abscisic Acid</h3>
	<p class="block_9">Abscisic acid (A B A) is a growth inhibitor which regulates abscission and dormancy. It increases tolerance of plants to various kinds of stress. So, it is also called as stress hormone. It is found in the chloroplast of plants.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Physiological effects of abscisic acid</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_66">A B A promotes the process of abscission (separation of leaves, flowers and fruits from the branch).</li>
	<li class="block_66">During water stress and drought conditions A B A causes stomatal closure.</li>
	<li class="block_6">A B A promotes senescence in leaves by causing loss of chlorophyll.</li>
	<li class="block_7">A B A induces bud dormancy towards the approach of winter in trees like birch.</li>
	<li class="block_8">A B A is a powerful inhibitor of lateral bud growth in tomato.</li>

	<p class="block_">As the banana continues to ripen in the first bag, it produces ethylene gas. The gas trapped in the bag will cause tomatoes to ripen. The tomatoes remain unripe in the second bag.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_496">16.1.5 Ethylene</h3>
	<p class="block_">Ethylene is a gaseous plant hormone. It is a growth inhibitor. It is mainly concerned with maturation and ripening of fruits. Maximum synthesis of ethylene occurs during ripening of fruits like apples, bananas and melons.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Physiological effects of ethylene</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_497">16.2 Human Endocrine Glands</h2>
	<p class="block_">Endocrine glands in animals possess a versatile communication system to coordinate biological functions. Exocrine glands and endocrine glands are two kinds of glands found in animals. Endocrine glands are found in different regions of the body of animals as well as human beings. These glands are called ductless glands. Their secretions are called hormones which are produced in minute quantities. The secretions diffuse into the blood stream and are carried to the distant parts of the body. They act on specific organs which are referred as target organs. </p>
	<p class="block_">Do you Know </p>
	<p class="block_">The branch of biology which deals with the study of the endocrine glands and its physiology is known as ‘Endocrinology’. Thomas Addison is known as Father of Endocrinology. English physiologists W. M. Bayliss and E. H. Starling introduced the term hormone in 1909. They first discovered the hormone secretin.</p>
	<p class="block_">Exocrine glands have specific ducts to carry their secretions example.salivary glands, mammary glands, sweat glands.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Endocrine glands present in human and other vertebrates are</p>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_498">16.2.1Pituitary Gland</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">The pituitary gland or hypophysis is a pea shaped compact mass of cells located at the base of the midbrain attached to the hypothalamus by a pituitary stalk. The pituitary gland is anatomically composed of two lobes and perform different functions. They are the anterior lobe (adenohypophysis) and the posterior lobe (neurohypophysis). The intermediate lobe is non-existent in humans.</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-255.png" alt="This Picture Shows the Image of the Pituitary Gland present in the Human Brain and also other parts near the Pituitary Gland are highlighted.  " class="calibre354"/></p>
	<p class="block_">Figure 16.7 Pituitary Gland</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The pituitary gland forms the major endocrine gland in most vertebrates. It regulates and controls other endocrine glands and so is called as the “Master gland”.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Hormones secreted by the anterior lobe (Adenohypophysis) of pituitary</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The anterior pituitary is composed of different types of cells and secrete hormones which stimulates the production of hormones by other endocrine glands. The hormones secreted by anterior pituitary are</p>
	<ol class="list_">

	<li class="block_65">Prolactin</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_63">Growth hormone (GH)</p>
	<p class="block_1054">GH promotes the development and enlargement of all tissues of the body. It stimulates the growth of muscles, cartilage and long bones. It controls the cell metabolism.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The improper secretion of this hormone leads to the following conditions.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Dwarfism:</b> It is caused by decreased secretion of growth hormone in children. The characteristic features are stunted growth, delayed skeletal formation and mental disability.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Gigantism: </b>Over secretion of growth hormone leads to gigantism in children. It is characterised by overgrowth of all body tissues and organs. Individuals attain abnormal increase in height.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Acromegaly:</b> Excess secretion of growth hormone in adults may lead to abnormal enlargement of head, face, hands and feet.</p>
	<p class="block_63">2 Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)</p>
	<p class="block_1054">TSH controls the growth of thyroid gland, coordinates its activities and hormone secretion.</p>
	<p class="block_63">3 Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)</p>
	<p class="block_1054">ACTH stimulates adrenal cortex of the adrenal gland for the production of its hormones. It also influences protein synthesis in the adrenal cortex.</p>
	<p class="block_63">4 Gonadotropic hormones (GTH)</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The gonadotropic hormones are follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone which are essential for the normal development of gonads.</p>
	<p class="block_63">5 Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)</p>
	<p class="block_1054">In male, it stimulates the germinal epithelium of testes for formation of sperms. In female it initiates the growth of ovarian follicles and its development in ovary.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Luteinizing hormone (LH)</p>
	<p class="block_1054">In male, it promotes the Leydig cells of the testes to secrete male sex hormone testosterone. In female, it causes ovulation (rupture of mature graafian follicle), responsible for the development of corpus luteum and production of female sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone.</p>
	<p class="block_63">6 Prolactin (PRL)</p>
	<p class="block_1054">PRL is also called lactogenic hormone. This hormone initiates development of mammary glands during pregnancy and stimulates the production of milk after childbirth.</p>
	<p class="block_63">More to Know</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland. It is known as a ‘time messenger’. It signals nighttime information throughout the body. Exposure to light at night, especially short-wavelength light, can decrease melatonin production interrupting sleep. Suppression of melatonin has been implicated in sleep disturbances and related metabolic disorders.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Hormones secreted by the posterior lobe (Neurohypophysis) of pituitary</p>

</ol>
	<p class="block_63">1 Vasopressin or Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)</p>
	<p class="block_1054">In kidney tubules it increases reabsorption of water. It reduces loss of water through urine and hence the name antidiuretic hormone. Deficiency of ADH reduces reabsorption of water and causes an increase in urine output (polyuria). This deficiency disorder is called Diabetes insipidus.</p>
	<p class="block_63">2 Oxytocin</p>
	<p class="block_1054">It helps in the contraction of the smooth muscles of uterus at the time of childbirth and milk ejection from the mammary gland after childbirth.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_499">16.2.2Thyroid Gland</h3>
	<p class="block_">The thyroid gland is composed of two distinct lobes lying one on either side of the trachea. The two lobes are connected by means of a narrow band of tissue known as the isthmus. This gland is composed of glandular follicles and lined by cuboidal epithelium. The follicles are filled with colloid material called thyroglobulin. </p>

	<p class="block_">Edward C. Kendal in 1914 first crystallised thyroxine hormone. Charles Harrington and George Barger identified the molecular structure of thyroxine in 1927. Thyroid gland requires “120 μg” of iodine every day for the production of thyroxine.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Thyroid Dysfunction</p>
	<p class="block_">When the thyroid gland fails to secrete the normal level of hormones, the condition is called thyroid dysfunction. It leads to the following conditions</p>
	<p class="block_12">Hypothyroidism</p>
	<p class="block_">It is caused due to the decreased secretion of the thyroid hormones. The abnormal conditions are simple goitre, cretinism and myxoedema.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Goitre</p>
	<p class="block_">It is caused due to the inadequate supply of iodine in our diet. This is commonly prevalent in Himalayan regions due to low level of iodine content in the soil. It leads to the enlargement of thyroid gland which protrudes as a marked swelling in the neck and is called as goitre.</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-256.png" alt="This picture shows the image of the Goitre in the neck" class="calibre356"/></p>
	<p class="block_12">Cretinism</p>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_503">16.2.6Reproductive Glands (Gonads)</h3>
	<p class="block_">The sex glands are of two types of the testes and the ovaries. The testes are present in male, while the ovaries are present in female.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Testes</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Testes are the reproductive glands of the males. They are composed of seminiferous tubules, Leydig cells and Sertoli cells. Leydig cells form the endocrine part of the testes. They secrete the male sex hormone called testosterone.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Functions of testosterone</p>
	<ul class="list_4">
	<li class="block_64">It influences the process of spermatogenesis.</li>

</ul>
	<p class="block_63">Ovary</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The ovaries are the female gonads located in the pelvic cavity of the abdomen. They secrete the female sex hormones</p>

	<li class="block_64">Estrogen</li>
	<li class="block_65">Progesterone</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_1054">Estrogen is produced by the Graafian follicles of the ovary and progesterone from the corpus luteum that is formed in the ovary from the ruptured follicle during ovulation.</p>

	<p class="block_1001">“Living organisms cannot survive for an indefinite period on earth. All living organisms have the ability to produce more of its own kind by the process called reproduction. Reproduction is the unfolding of life forms where new individuals are formed. It ensures continuity and survival of the species. This process is to preserve individual species and it is called as self-perpetuation. The time required to reproduce also varies from organism to organism. You may find great variations in period of reproduction in yeast, bacteria, rat, cow, elephant and humans. In sexual reproduction off springs are produced by the union of male and female gametes (sperm and egg). The male and female gametes contain the genetic material or genes present on the chromosomes which transmit the characteristic traits to the next generation. There are three types of reproduction in plants namely </p>

	<p class="block_1001">Production of an offspring by a single parent without the formation and fusion of gametes is called asexual reproduction. It involves only mitotic cell divisions and meiosis does not occur. Offspring produced by asexual reproduction are not only identical to parents but are also exact copies of their parent.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Asexual reproduction occurs by spore formation. This is the most common method of asexual reproduction in fungi and bacteria.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">During spore formation a structure called sporangium develops from the fungal hypha. The nucleus divides several times within the sporangium and each nucleus with small amount of cytoplasm develops into a spore. The spores are liberated, and they develop into new hypha after reaching the ground or substratum.</p>

	<p class="block_">Sexual reproduction is the process in which two gametes (male and female) are fused to produce offspring of their own kind. In such cases both sexes, male and female sex organs are needed to produce gametes. You have already learnt that the flower is a reproductive organ of a flowering plant. To understand this further we need to study the structure of a flower.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_522">17.3.1 Parts of a Typical Flower</h3>
	<p class="block_">A flower is a modified shoot with limited growth to carry out sexual reproduction. A flower consists of four whorls borne on a thalamus. These whorls are from outside</p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li class="block_6">Calyx – consisting of sepals</li>

	<li class="block_8">Dust the pollen grains on a slide and observe under a microscope.</li>
</ul>
	<p class="block_1001">The two outermost whorls calyx and corolla are non-essential or accessory whorls as they do not directly take part in the reproduction. The other two whorls androecium and gynoecium are known as the essential whorls, because both take part directly in reproduction.</p>
	<p class="block_1001"><b class="calibre36">Androecium:</b> Androecium, the male part of flower is composed of stamens. Each stamen consists of a stalk called the filament and a small bag like structure called anther at the tip. The pollen grains are produced in the anther within the pollen sac.</p>
	<p class="block_1001"><img src="images/image-271.png" alt="This picture shows the image of Anther  and image of pollen grain " class="calibre372"/></p>
	<p class="block_1001"><b class="calibre36">Pollen grain:</b> Pollen grains are usually spherical in shape. It has two layered walls. The hard- outer layer is known as exine. It has prominent apertures called germ pore. The inner thin layer is known as intine. It is a thin and continuous layer made up of cellulose and pectin. Mature pollen grains contain two cells, the vegetative and the generative cell. Vegetative cell contains a large nucleus. The generative cell divides mitotically to form two male gametes.</p>
	<p class="block_1001"><b class="calibre36">Gynoecium:</b> Gynoecium is the female part of the flower and is made up of carpels. It has three parts:</p>

	<p class="block_1001">The embryo sac contains seven cells and the eighth nuclei located within the nucellus. Three cells at the micropylar end form the egg apparatus and the three cells at the chalaza end are the antipodal cells. The remaining two nuclei are called polar nuclei found in the centre. In the egg apparatus one is the egg cell (female gamete), and the remaining two cells are the synergids.</p>

	<p class="block_">In order to bring about cross pollination, it is necessary that the pollen should be carried from one flower to another of a different plant. This takes place through the agency of animals, insects, wind and water.</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_6"><b class="calibre6">Pollination by wind</b></li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_533">The pollination with the help of wind is called anemophily. The anemophilous flowers produce enormous amount of pollen grains. The pollen grains are small, smooth, dry and light in weight. Pollen of such plants are blown off at a distance of more than 1,000 km. The stigmas are comparatively large, protruding and sometimes hairy to trap the pollen grains. Example  Grasses and some cacti.</p>

	<li value="2" class="block_7"><b class="calibre6">Pollination by insects</b></li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_533">Pollination with the help of insects like honeybees, flies are called entomophily. To attract insects these flowers are brightly coloured, have smell and nectar. The pollen grains are larger in size, the exine is pitted, spiny etcetera. so they can be adhered firmly on the sticky stigma. Approximately, 80% of the pollination done by the insects is carried by honeybees.</p>

	<p class="block_1054">You have studied the structural details of the male and female reproductive system in 9th standard. In human beings the male and female reproductive organs differ anatomically and physiologically. New individuals develop by the fusion of gametes. Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of two haploid gametes (male and the female gametes) to form a diploid individual (zygote).</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Organs of the reproductive system are divided into primary and secondary (accessory) sex organs.</p>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_529">17.7.1 Male Reproductive Organ - Structure of Testes</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Testes are the reproductive glands of the male that are oval shaped organs which lie outside the abdominal cavity of a man in a sac like structure called scrotum. Now we shall study the various cells which are present in the testes.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Each testis is covered with a layer of fibrous tissue called tunica albuginea. Many septa from this layer divide the testes into pyramidal lobules, in which lie seminiferous tubules, cells of Sertoli, and the Leydig cells (interstitial cells).</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The process of spermatogenesis takes place in the seminiferous tubules. The Sertoli cells are the supporting cells and provide nutrients to the developing sperms. The Leydig cells are polyhedral in shape and lie between the seminiferous tubules and secrete testosterone. It initiates the process of spermatogenesis.</p>

	<p class="block_1054">The ovaries are located on either side of the lower abdomen composed of two almond shaped bodies, each lying near the lateral end of fallopian tube. Each ovary is a compact structure consisting of an outer cortex and an inner medulla. The cortex is composed of a network of connective tissue called as stroma and is lined by the germinal epithelium. The epithelial cells called the granulosa cells surround each ovum in the ovary together forming the primary follicle. As the egg grows larger, the follicle also enlarges and gets filled with the fluid and is called the Graafian follicle.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Info bits</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The number of primordial follicles in newborn female child ranges over 7 million and during reproductive period (at puberty) the number is around 60,000 to 70,000. During a woman’s lifetime, she will only ovulate 300 to 400 of the 1-2 million eggs, she was initially born with. On the other side, men will produce over 500 billion sperms in their lifetime.</p>

	<p class="block_1054">The formation of the sperm in male and the ovum in female is called gametogenesis. It involves spermatogenesis (formation of spermatozoa) and oogenesis (the formation of ova). Gametes with haploid cells are produced through gametogenesis.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_532">17.8.1Structure of Human Sperm</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">The spermatozoan consists of head, a middle piece and tail. The sperm head is elongated and formed by the condensation of nucleus. The anterior portion has a cap like structure called acrosome. It contains hyaluronidase an enzyme that helps the sperm to enter the ovum during fertilization. A short neck connects the head and middle piece which comprises the centrioles. The middle piece contains the mitochondria which provides energy for the movement of tail. It brings about sperm motility which is essential for fertilization.</p>

	<p class="block_1054">The mature ovum or egg is spherical in shape. The ovum is almost free of yolk. It contains abundant cytoplasm and the nucleus. The ovum is surrounded by three membranes. The plasma membrane is surrounded by inner thin zona pellucida and an outer thick corona radiata. The corona radiata is formed of follicle cells. The membrane forming the surface layer of the ovum is called vitelline membrane. The fluid-filled space between zona pellucida and the surface of the egg is called perivitelline space.</p>

	<p class="block_12">Puberty</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The reproductive system in both males and females becomes functional and an increase in sex hormone production resulting in puberty. This phenomenon tends to start earlier in females than in males. Generally, boys attain puberty between the age of 13 to 14 years, while girls reach puberty between 11 to 13 years. In male, the onset of puberty is triggered by the secretion of the hormone testosterone in the testes, in female the secretion of estrogens and progesterone from the ovary. The secretion of both male and female hormones is under the control of the pituitary gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).</p>

	<p class="block_1001">The cyclic events that take place in a rhythmic fashion during the reproductive period of a woman’s life is called menstrual cycle. In human females the menstrual cycle starts at the age of 11-13 years which marks the onset of puberty and is called menarche and ceases around 48-50 years of age and this stage is termed menopause. The reproductive period is marked by characteristic events repeated almost every month in physiologically normal women (28 days with minor variation) in the form of a menstrual flow. The menstrual cycle consists of 4 phases</p>

	<p class="block_1001">Menstruation is a periodical phenomenon that continues from puberty to menopause. This will happen if the released ovum is not fertilized by the sperm. Lack of menstruation generally indicates pregnancy.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_535">17.10 Fertilization to Foetal Development</h2>
	<p class="block_1002">Fertilization</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Fertilization in human is internal and occurs in the oviduct of the female genital tract. It takes place usually in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. An oocyte is alive for about 24 hours after it is released from the follicle. Fertilisation must take place within 24 hours. The sperm enters into the ovum and fuses with it, resulting in the formation of a ‘zygote’. This process is called fertilization. The zygote is a fertilized ovum.</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Cleavage and Formation of Blastula</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The first cleavage takes place about 30 hours after fertilization. Cleavage is a series of rapid mitotic divisions of the zygote to form many celled <span id="id_Int_znkokk8k">blastula (Blastocyst) which comprises an outer layer of smaller cells and inner mass of larger cells.</span></p>
	<p class="block_1002">Implantation</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The blastocyst (fertilized egg) reaches the uterus and gets implanted in the uterus. The process of attachment of the blastocyst to the uterine wall (endometrium) is called implantation. The fertilized egg becomes implanted in about 6 to 7 days after fertilization.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Gastrulation</p>
	<p class="block_">The transformation of blastula into gastrula and the formation of primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm) by rearrangement of the cells is called gastrulation. This takes place after the process of implantation.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Info bits</p>
	<p class="block_">Normally one egg matures in the ovary each month. Ovulation is the rupture of the follicle releasing the egg or <span id="id_Int_sEIfylPs" class="calibre203">ovum . The uterus prepares itself to receive the fertilized egg every month. The uterine lining becomes thick and spongy for implantation of the fertilized egg. </span></p>
	<p class="block_">Events leading to when fertilization occurs and does not occur </p>
	<p class="block_">If fertilization takes place the corpus luteum persists, continues to secrete progesterone maintains the thickened state of uterine wall and prevents maturation of another follicle till the end of pregnancy. </p>
	<p class="block_">If fertilization does not occur, corpus luteum degenerates, the egg disintegrates and the uterine lining slowly breaks, discharged as blood and mucus leading to menstrual events.</p>

	<p class="block_">Figure 17.18 Developmental stages of zygote from cleavage to blastocyst formation</p>
	<p class="block_12">Organogenesis</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The establishment of the germ layers namely ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm initiate the final phase of embryonic development. During organogenesis the various organs of the foetus are established from the different germ layers attaining a functional state.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Formation of Placenta</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The placenta is a disc shaped structure attached to the uterine wall and is a temporary association between the developing embryo and maternal tissues. It allows the exchange of food materials, diffusion of oxygen, excretion of nitrogenous wastes and elimination of carbon dioxide. A cord containing blood vessels that connects the placenta with the foetus is called the umbilical cord.</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Pregnancy (Gestation)</p>
	<p class="block_1001">It is the time period during which the embryo attains its development in the uterus. Normally gestation period of human last for about 280 days. During pregnancy the uterus expands up to 500 times of its normal size.</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Parturition (Childbirth)</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Parturition is the expulsion of young one from the mother’s uterus at the end of gestation. Oxytocin from the posterior pituitary stimulates the uterine contractions and provides force to expel the baby from the uterus, causing birth.</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Do You Know</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Sometimes ovaries release two eggs and each is fertilised by a different sperm, resulting in Non-Identical Twins (Fraternal Twins). If single egg is fertilised and then divides into two foetus, Identical Twins develop.</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Lactation</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The process of milk production after childbirth from mammary glands of the mother is called lactation. The first fluid which is released from the mammary gland after childbirth is called as colostrum. Milk production from alveoli of mammary glands is stimulated by prolactin secreted from the anterior pituitary. The ejection of milk is stimulated by posterior pituitary hormone oxytocin.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Info bits</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The milk produced from the breast during the first 2 to 3 days after childbirth is called colostrum. It contains immune substances and provides immunity to the newborn which is essential for the body.</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_537">17.12 Population Explosion and Family Planning</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Population explosion defined as the sudden and rapid rise in the size of population, especially human population. Realizing the dangers inherent in population growth, the Government of India has taken several measures to check population growth and introduced family planning. India has been one of the first country in the world to launch the nationwide family planning programme in 1952.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Family planning is a way of living that is adopted voluntarily by couples on the basis of knowledge and responsible decisions to promote the health and welfare of the family group and society. The W H O (World Health Organisation) has also stressed the importance of family planning as global strategy health for all.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Do You Know</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The inverted red triangle is a symbol of family planning in India for family welfare. It is displayed prominently at all hospitals, primary health clinics and family welfare centres where any help or advice about family planning is available free of cost. The symbol is displayed along with a slogan Small Family, Happy Family.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_538">17.12.1. Contraception </h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Contraception is one of the best birth control measures. A number of techniques or methods have been developed to prevent pregnancies in women. The devices used for contraception are called contraceptive devices. Common contraceptive methods used to prevent pregnancy are discussed here. </p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_1182">Barrier methods</li>
	<li class="block_1183">Hormonal methods</li>
	<li class="block_1183">Intra-Uterine Devices (IUD s)</li>
	<li class="block_1184">Surgical methods</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_63">Barrier Methods</p>
	<p class="block_1054">This method prevents sperms from meeting the ovum. Its entry into the female reproductive tract is prevented by barrier.</p>
	<ol class="list_2">
	<li class="block_64"><b class="calibre6">Condom:</b> Condom prevents deposition of sperms in the vagina. Condoms are made of thin rubber or latex sheath. Condom also protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STD) like syphilis, AIDS.</li>
	<li class="block_65"><b class="calibre6">Diaphragm (Cervical cap):</b> Vaginal diaphragm fitting into the vagina or a cervical cap fitting over the cervix. This prevents the entry of sperms into the uterus.</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_63">Hormonal Methods</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Hormonal preparations are in the form of pills or tablets (contraceptive pills). These hormones stop (interfere with ovulation) the release of egg from the ovary.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Intra-Uterine Devices (IUD s)</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The intrauterine device (IUD) are contraceptive devices inserted into the uterus. There are two synthetic devices commonly used in India are</p>
	<p class="block_1054"> Lippe’s Loop and Copper-T made of copper and plastic (non-irritant). This can remain for a period of 3 years. This reduces the sperm fertilizing capacity and prevents implantation. This also helps to give adequate time interval between pregnancies.</p>
	<p class="block_9"><img src="images/image-282.png" alt="This picture shows the image of Copper-T" class="calibre384"/></p>
	<p class="block_9">Figure 17.19 Copper-T</p>
	<p class="block_18"> </p>
	<p class="block_19">Surgical Methods</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Surgical contraception or sterilization techniques are terminal methods to prevent any pregnancy. This procedure in males is vasectomy (ligation of vas deferens) and in females it is tubectomy (ligation of fallopian tube). These are methods of permanent birth control.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_539">17.13 Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Many diseases affect both women and men, but a few diseases occur at a higher frequency in woman. Women are susceptible to U T I from the bacteria that are present on skin, rectum or vagina. This will enter the urethra, before moving upwards. The types of <span id="id_Int_EvNET3cD" class="calibre203">U T I are:</span></p>
	<p class="block_63">1 Cystitis or Bladder infection</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Bacteria lodged in the urinary bladder thrive and multiply leading to inflammation. It is most common in the age group of 20 to 50.</p>
	<p class="block_63">2 Kidney Infection</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The bacteria can travel from the urinary bladder and upward to ureter and affect one or both the kidneys. It also infects the blood stream and leads to serious life-threatening complications.</p>
	<p class="block_63">3 Asymptomatic Bacteriuria</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The bacteria present in the urinary bladder which may not show any symptoms.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_540">17.14 Personal Hygiene</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Hygiene is the practice of healthy living and personal cleanliness. Personal hygiene is caring of one’s own body and health. Social hygiene is proper care of the surrounding environment. The main aspect of hygiene is body hygiene, food hygiene, sanitary hygiene and hygienic environment.</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_562">Introduction</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">“Like Begets Like” is an important and universal phenomenon of life as the living beings produce offspring of their own kind. Colour of eye, colour of hair, shape of nose, type of earlobe, etcetera, are inheritable traits. Have you ever wondered, how do we inherit traits and characteristics from our father and mother? Some of our characteristics might have been inherited from our grandparents. How do we inherit characters from one generation to another? It is because of the genes we inherit from our parents. These genes are responsible for the physical outlook and biological functions. The branch of biology that deals with the genes, genetic variation and heredity of living organisms is called genetics.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Heredity is transmission of characters, from one generation to the next generation, while variation refers to the differences shown by the individuals of the same species and also by the offspring of the same parents. All these can happen only due to chromosomes. Now let’s see what chromosomes are and how they are composed with DNA, that form the genetic material.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_563">18.1Gregor Johann Mendel - Father of Genetics</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Mendel (1822-1884) was an Austrian monk who discovered the basic principles of heredity through his experiments. His experiments are the foundation for modern genetics. He was born in 1822 to a family of farmers in Silesian of Czechoslovakia. After finishing his high school at the age of 18, he entered the Augustinian Monastery at Brunn as a priest. From there he went to the University of Vienna for training in physics, mathematics and natural science. Mendel returned to the monastery in 1854 and continued to work as a priest and teach in high school. In his leisure time he started his famous experiments on the garden pea plant. He conducted his experiments in the monastery for about seven years from 1856 to 1863. He had worked on nearly 10000 pea plants of 34 different varieties. Mendel noted that they differ from one another in many ways.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Thus, Mendel had chosen 7 pairs of contrasting characters for his study as shown in the table.</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_564">18.2Monohybrid Cross – Inheritance of One Gene</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Crosses involving inheritance of only one pair of contrasting characters are called monohybrid crosses. For example, it is a cross between two forms of a single trait like a cross between tall and dwarf plant.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Mendel’s Explanation of Monohybrid Cross </p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Parental generation:</b> Pure breeding tall plant and a pure breeding dwarf plant.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">F1 generation:</b> Plants raised from the seeds of pure breeding parental cross in F1 generation were tall and monohybrids.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">F2 generation: </b>Selling of the F1 monohybrids resulted in tall and dwarf plants respectively in the ratio of 3 is to1. The actual number of tall and dwarf plants obtained by Mendel was 787 tall and 277 dwarf. External expression of a particular trait is known as phenotype. So, the phenotypic ratio is 3 is to1.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">In the F2 generation 3 different types were obtained:</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Tall Homozygous – T T (Pure) – 1 </p>
	<p class="block_1054">Tall Heterozygous – T t – 2</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Dwarf Homozygous – t t – 1</p>
	<p class="block_1054">So, the genotypic ratio 1 is to 2 is to1. A genotype is the genetic expression of an organism</p>
	<p class="block_63">Mendel’s Interpretation on Monohybrid cross</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Based on these observations it was confirmed by Mendel that ‘factors’ are passed on from one generation to another, now referred to as genes. Tallness and Dwarfness are determined by a pair of contrasting factors, tall plant possess a pair of factors (represented by capital T- taking the first letter of the dominant character) and a plant is dwarf because it possesses factors for dwarfness (represented as small t- recessive character). These factors occur</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-289.png" alt="Monohybrid cross explained in the image as follows parental generation gametes capital T small t. f 1 generation genotype all are capital T small t phenotype all are tall. f 2 generation genotype capital T capital T is to capital T small t is to small t small t = 1 is to 2 is to 1 phenotype tall is to dwarf = 3 is to 1. " class="calibre391"/></p>
	<p class="block_12">Figure 18.1 Monohybrid cross</p>
	<p class="block_1054">in pairs and may be alike as in pure breeding tall plants (capital TT) and dwarf plants (small tt). This is referred to as homozygous. If they are unlike (capital T small t) they are referred to as heterozygous.</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_64">Two factors making up a pair of contrasting characters are called alleles or allelomorphs. One member of each pair is contributed by one parent.</li>
	<li class="block_1055">When two factors for alternative expression of a trait are brought together by fertilization. </li>
	<li class="block_1055">The character which expresses itself is called dominant (Tallness) condition and that which is masked is called recessive condition (dwarfness).</li>
	<li class="block_65">The factors are always pure and when gametes are formed, the unit factors segregate so that each gamete gets one of the two alternative factors. It means that factors for tallness(capital T) and dwarfness(small t) are separate entities and in a gamete either capital T or small t is present. When F1 hybrids are self crossed the two entities separate and then unite independently, forming tall and dwarf plants.</li>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_565">18.3Dihybrid Cross- </h2>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_566">Inheritance Two Genes and Law of Independent Assortment</h2>
	<p class="block_">Dihybrid cross involves the inheritance of two pairs of contrasting characteristics (or contrasting traits) at the same time. The two pairs of contrasting characteristics chosen by Mendel were shape and colour of seeds: round-yellow seeds and wrinkled-green seeds.</p>
	<p class="block_">Mendel crossed pea plants having round- yellow seeds with pea plants having wrinkled- green seeds. Mendel made the following observations:</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_6">Mendel first crossed pure breeding pea plants having round-yellow seeds with pure breeding pea plants having wrinkled- green seeds and found that only round- yellow seeds were produced in the first generation (F1). No wrinkled-green seeds were obtained in the F1 generation. From this it was concluded that round shape and yellow colour of the seeds were dominant traits over the wrinkled shape and green colour of the seeds.</li>
	<li class="block_65">When the hybrids of F1 generation pea plants having round-yellow seeds were cross-bred by self-pollination, then four types of seeds having different combinations of shape and colour were obtained in second generation or F2 generation. They were round yellow, round-green, wrinkled yellow and wrinkled-green seeds.</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-290.png" alt="Dihybrid Cross Explained as follows parental generation pure breeding round yellow seeds and pure breeding wrinkled seeds. first generation round yellow seeds undergoes self pollination. phenotype ratio of F 2 generation 9 is to 3 is to 3 is to 1 round yellow 9 wrinkled yellow 3 round green 3 wrinkled green 1. " class="calibre392"/></p>
	<p class="block_">Figure 18.2 Dihybrid Cross</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The ratio of each phenotype (or appearance) of seeds in the F2 generation is 9 is to3 is to 3 is to 1. This is known as the Dihybrid ratio.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">From the above results it can be concluded that the factors for each character or trait remain independent and maintain their identity in the gametes. The factors are independent to each other and pass to the offsprings (through gametes).</p>
	<p class="block_63">Results of a Dihybrid Cross:</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Mendel got the following results from his dihybrid cross</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_568">18.5 Chromosomes, DNA and Genes</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">The human body is made up of million cells. The nucleus of each cell contains thin thread like structures called chromosomes. The term ‘chromosomes’ was first coined by Waldeyer in 1888. The chromosomes are the carrier of genetic material which contain the heredity information.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The chromosomes are highly condensed coiled chromatin fibres packed with the DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) that forms the genetic material. Genes are segments of DNA, which are responsible for the inheritance of a particular phenotypic character. Each gene is present at a specific position on a chromosome called its locus. During cell division, the genetic information present in the genes is passed from one generation to another.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_569">18.5.1Structure of a Chromosome</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">The chromosomes are thin, long and thread like structures consisting of two identical strands called sister chromatids. They are held together by the centromere. Each chromatid is made up of spirally coiled thin structure called chromonema. The chromonema has number of bead-like structures along its length which are called chromomeres. The chromosomes are made up of DNA, RNA, chromosomal proteins (histones and non-histones) and certain metallic ions. These proteins provide structural support to the chromosome.</p>

	<p class="block_1054">A chromosome consists of the following regions</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Primary constriction:</b> The two arms of a chromosome meet at a point called primary constriction or centromere. The centromere is the region where spindle fibres attach to the chromosomes during cell division.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Secondary constriction:</b> Some chromosomes possess secondary constriction at any point of the chromosome. They are known as the nuclear zone or nucleolar organizer (formation of nucleolus in the nucleus).</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Telomere:</b> The end of the chromosome is called telomere. Each extremity of the chromosome has a polarity and prevents it from joining the adjacent chromosome. It maintains and provides stability to the chromosomes.</p>
	<p class="block_9"><b class="calibre36">Satellite:</b> Some of the chromosomes have an elongated knob-like appendage at one end of the chromosome known as satellite. The chromosomes with satellites are called as the sat-chromosomes.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Do you Know </p>
	<p class="block_12">Telomeres act as aging clock in every cell.</p>
	<p class="block_">Telomeres are protective sequences of nucleotides found in chromosomes. As a cell divides every time, they become shorter. Telomeres get too short to do their job, causing our cells to age.</p>

	<p class="block_1001">The eukaryotic chromosomes are classified into autosomes and allosomes.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Autosomes contain genes that determine the somatic (body) characters. Male and female have equal number of autosomes.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Allosomes are chromosomes which are responsible for determining the sex of an individual. They are also called as sex chromosomes or hetero-chromosomes. There are two types of sex chromosomes, X and Y- chromosomes. Human male has one X-chromosome and one Y chromosome and human female have two X chromosomes.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_572">18.5.4Karyotype</h3>
	<p class="block_1001">The number of chromosomes in any living organism (animal or plant) is constant. In human, each cell normally contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. Out of which 22 pairs are autosomes and the 23rd pair is the allosome or sex chromosome.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">In the body cells of sexually reproducing organisms, the chromosomes generally occur in pairs. This condition is called diploid (2n). The gametes produced by the organisms contain a single set of chromosomes. Hence, the gametes are said to be haploid (n).<br class="calibre26"/>Karyotype is the number, size and shape of chromosomes in the cell nucleus of an organism. Idiogram is the diagrammatic representation of karyotype of a species. It consists of all the metaphasic chromosomes arranged in homologous pairs according to decreasing length, thickness, position of centromere, shape etcetera., with the sex chromosomes placed at the end.</p>

The most widely accepted model of DNA is the double helical structure of James Watson and Francis Crick. They proposed the three-dimensional model of DNA on the basis of X-ray diffraction studies of DNA obtained by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. In appreciation of their discoveries on the molecular structure of nucleic acids Watson, Crick and Wilkins were awarded Nobel prize for Medicine in 1962.</p>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_575">18.6.2DNA Replication</h3>
	<p class="block_">DNA replication is one of the basic processes that occurs within a cell. DNA molecule produces exact copies of its own structure during replication process. The two strands of a DNA molecule have complementary base pairs, the nucleotides of each strand provide the information needed to produce its new strand. The two resulting daughter cells contain exactly the same genetic information as the parent cell. DNA replication involves the following steps</p>
	<p class="block_12">Origin of replication</p>
	<p class="block_">The specific points on the DNA, where the replication begins, is the site of origin of replication. The two strands open and separate at this point forming the replication fork.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Unwinding of DNA molecule</p>
	<p class="block_">The enzyme called helicase, bind to the origin of replication site. Helicase separates the two strands of the DNA. The enzyme called topoisomerase separates the double helix above the replication fork and removes the twists formed during the unwinding process. Each of the separated DNA strands function as a template.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Formation of RNA primer</p>
	<p class="block_1001">An RNA primer is a short segment of RNA nucleotides. The primer is synthesized by the DNA template close to the origin of replication site.</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-296.png" alt="Replication of DNA in Explained " class="calibre400"/></p>
	<p class="block_">Figure 18.8 Replication of DNA</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Synthesis of new complementary strand from the parent strand</p>
	<p class="block_1001">After the formation of RNA primer, nucleotides are added with the help of an enzyme DNA polymerase and a new complementary strand of DNA is formed from each of the parent strand. The synthesis is unidirectional.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">In one strand, the daughter strand is synthesized as a continuous strand which is called leading strand. In the other strand, short segments of DNA are synthesized. This strand is called lagging strand. The short segments of DNA are called Okazaki fragments. The fragments are joined together by the enzyme, DNA ligase.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">The replication stops when the replication fork of the two sides meets at a site called terminus, which is situated opposite to origin of replication site</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_577">18.7Sex Determination</h2>
	<p class="block_">The formation of zygote into male or female sex during development is called sex determination. Sex is determined by the chromosomes of an individual.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_578">18.7.1Sex Determination in Human</h3>
	<p class="block_">Recall that human beings have 23 pairs of chromosomes out of which 22 pairs are autosomes and one pair (23rd pair) is the sex chromosome. The female gametes or the eggs formed are similar in their chromosome type (22+XX). Therefore, human females are homogametic.</p>
	<p class="block_">The male gametes or sperms produced are of two types. They are produced in equal proportions. The sperm bearing (22+X) chromosomes and the sperm bearing (22+Y) chromosomes. The human males are called heterogametic.</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-297.png" alt="This image shows the Sex Determination in Human - Part 1 " class="calibre401"/><b class="calibre6"><img src="images/image-298.png" alt="This image displays Sex determination in human - Part 2" class="calibre402"/></b></p>
	<p class="block_12">Figure 18.9 Sex determination in human<span class="tab">      </span></p>
	<p class="block_">It is a chance of probability as to which category of sperm fuses with the egg. If the egg (X) is fused by the X-bearing sperm an XX individual (female) is produced. If the egg (X) is fused by the Y-bearing sperm an XY individual (male) is produced. The sperm, produced by the father, determines the sex of the child. The mother is not responsible in determining the sex of the child.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Now let’s see how the chromosomes take part in this formation. Fertilization of the egg (22+X) with a sperm (22+X) will produce a female child (44+XX). while fertilization of the egg (22+X) with a sperm (22+Y) will give rise to a male child (44+XY).</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_579">18.7.2Mutation</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">The term mutation was introduced by Hugo De Vries in 1901 when he observed phenotypic changes in the evening primrose plant, Oenothera jamarckiana. Mutation is an inheritable sudden change in the genetic material (DNA) of an organism. Mutations are classified into two main types, namely chromosomal mutation and gene mutation.</p>
	<p class="block_63">1 </p>
	<p class="block_63">Chromosomal mutation</p>

	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_64"><b class="calibre6">Changes in the structure of chromosomes</b>: Structural changes in the chromosomes usually occurs due to errors in cell division. Changes in the number and arrangement of genes takes place as a result of deletion, duplication, inversion and translocation in chromosomes.</li>

	<p class="block_1054">Euploidy: It is the condition in which the individual bears more than the usual number of diploid (2n) chromosomes. If an individual has three haploid sets of chromosomes, the condition is called triploidy (3n). Triploid plants and animals are typically sterile. If it has four haploid sets of chromosomes, the condition is called tetraploidy (4n). Tetraploid plants are advantageous as they often result in increased fruit and flower size.</p>

	<p class="block_">Figure 18.10 Euploidy</p>
	<p class="block_">Aneuploidy: It is the loss or gain of one or more chromosomes in a set. It is of three types. Monosomy (2n minus 1), Trisomy (2n+1) and Nullisomy (2n minus 2). In man, Down’s syndrome is one of the commonly known aneuploid condition.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Down’s syndrome</p>
	<p class="block_">This condition was first identified by a doctor named Langdon Down in1866.</p>
	<p class="block_">It is a genetic condition in which there is an extra copy of chromosome 21 (Trisomy 21). It is associated with mental retardation, delayed development, behavioural problems, weak muscle tone, vision and hearing disability are some of the conditions seen in these children.</p>

	<p class="block_12">Figure 18.11 Aneuploidy</p>
	<p class="block_12">2 Gene or point mutation</p>
	<p class="block_">Gene mutation is the changes occurring in nucleotide sequence of a gene. It involves substitution, deletion, insertion or inversion of a single or more than one nitrogenous base. Gene alteration results in abnormal protein formation in an organism.</p>
	<p class="block_">Do you Know </p>
	<p class="block_">Sickle cell anaemia is caused by the mutation of a single gene. Alteration in the gene brings a change in the structure of the protein part of haemoglobin molecule. Due to the change in the protein molecule, the red blood cell (RBC) that carries the haemoglobin is sickle shaped.</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_592">Introduction</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Living organisms possess distinct characteristics, display organisational and functional unity, entail a mechanism of origin and evolution of diversities and maintain a balanced relationship with nature. Most aspects of evolution indicate that the knowledge of the past has become essential for fully understanding the present. Life since its beginning on earth had changed through time. The history of life comprises of two aspects, one is the origin of life on earth and the other is mechanism involved in the gradual changes and adaptations of living organisms through time which is known as the evolution of life</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Origin of Earth</b>: Origin of life is linked with the origin of earth. The Big Bang theory explains the Origin of Universe. It proposes that the universe had an explosive beginning (Big Bang) and originated 15 billion years ago. The universe comprised of stars, clouds of gas and dust which form the galaxies. The solar system was probably created when the gaseous clouds started to collapse due to the force of its own gravity forming atoms and particles. Atoms, dust grains and gaseous disc aggregated to form clumps and gave rise to planets. This forms the solar system of the milky way galaxy. Earth was supposed to have been formed about 4.5 billion years back. Life appeared 500 million years after the formation of earth.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_593">19.1 Theories on Origin of Life</h2>
	<p class="block_1001">Many theories have been postulated to explain the origin of life. The views on the origin of life have been put forth as</p>
	<p class="block_1001"><b class="calibre36">Special creation:</b> This idea embodies that life on Earth is a divine creation and also attributes to supernatural event at a particular time in the past. It also emphasizes that life has not changed ever since its origin.</p>
	<p class="block_1001"><b class="calibre36">Spontaneous generation (Abiogenesis):</b> According to this theory life originated spontaneously from lifeless matter. It was believed that fishes originated from mud, frogs from moist soil and insects from decaying matter.</p>
	<p class="block_1001"><b class="calibre36">Biogenesis:</b> It was speculated by Louis Pasteur (in1862) that life originates from pre-existing life. He showed that pre-sterilised flasks kept closed airtight, with killed yeast, did not give rise to any life form, while in another flask kept open to air living organisms arose from killed yeast.</p>
	<p class="block_1001"><b class="calibre36">Extra-terrestrial or Cosmic origin:</b> Some scientists still believe that life came from outer space. This states that units of life called spores (Panspermia) were transferred to different planets including earth. This is still an idea of some astronomers. Chemical Evolution of Life: This idea was developed by Oparin (in1922) and Haldane(in1929). They proposed that with the condition prevailing on earth, life arose by a series of sequential chemical reactions. The first form of life could have come from pre-existing non- living inorganic molecules which gave rise to formation of diverse organic molecules which are transformed into colloid system to produce life. The modern concept on chemical evolution regarding origin of life was accepted.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_594">19.2 Evidences of Evolution</h2>
	<p class="block_1001">Evolution can be better understood only by observing the interrelationship between the existing organisms and also relating the similarities with the extinct organisms. The inter relationship of the organisms is also supported by evidences from different branches of biology. These evidences support the concept that all organisms have evolved from common ancestors.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_595">19.2.1 Evidences from Morphology and Anatomy</h3>
	<p class="block_1001">The comparative study of morphology and anatomy of animals, reveal that they possess common set of characteristics.</p>
	<p class="block_1002">1.</p>
	<p class="block_1001"><b class="calibre36"> Homologous organs:</b> The homologous organs are those which have inherited from common ancestors with similar developmental pattern in embryos. The fore limbs of mammals are homologous structures. A human hand, a front leg of a cat, flipper of a whale and a bat’s wing look dissimilar and adapted for different functions. Their mode of development and basic structure of bone are similar.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Figure 19.1 Forelimbs of vertebrates showing homologous structure</p>
	<p class="block_1001"><img src="images/image-304.png" alt="Forelimbs of vertebrates showing homologous structure has following common parts, human and cat has following homologous structure humerus radius ulna carpal meta carpal phalanges. whale and bat has following homologous structure humerus radius carpal meta carpal phalanges ulna." class="calibre410"/></p>
	<p class="block_1087"> </p>
	<p class="block_">2 Analogous organs: The analogous organs look similar and perform similar functions but they have different origin and developmental pattern. The function of the wings of a bat, the wings of a bird and wings of an insect are similar, but their basic structures are different.</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-305.png" alt="Image shows the Analogous structure showing a bat wing, a bird wing and an insect wing" class="calibre411"/></p>
	<p class="block_12">Figure 19.2 Analogous structure showing a bat wing, a bird wing and an insect wing</p>
	<p class="block_">3 </p>
	<p class="block_"> Vestigial organs: The degenerated and non-functional organs of animals are called vestigial organs. The same organs are found to be well- developed and functional, in some of the related forms. Some of the vestigial organs in man are vermiform appendix, nictitating membrane, caudal vertebra, coccyx etc.</p>
	<p class="block_">4 </p>
	<p class="block_">Atavism: The reappearance of ancestral characters in some individuals is called atavism. e.g., Presence of rudimentary tail in new born babies, presence of thick hair on the human body.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_596">19.2.2 Evidences from Embryology</h3>
	<p class="block_">The study of comparative embryology of different animals, supports the concept of evolution. The embryos from fish to mammals are similar in their early stages of development. The differentiation of their special characters appears in the later stages of development.</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-306.png" alt="Embryonic development of vertebrates as follows fish salamander tortoise chick rabbit man." class="calibre412"/></p>
	<p class="block_">Figure 19.3 Embryonic development of vertebrates</p>
	<p class="block_">Biogenetic law or Recapitulation theory was given by Ernst Haeckel. According to this theory, Ontogeny recapitulates Phylogeny. The stages of development of the individual animal repeats the evolutionary history of the entire race of the animal.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_597">19.2.2 Evidences from Palaeontology</h3>
	<p class="block_12"> <img src="images/image-307.png" alt="A QR code is given with a code of OA2ZS" class="calibre413"/></p>
	<p class="block_">Palaeontology deals with the study of fossils. Leonardo da Vinci is called the Father of Palaeontology. The study of fossils helps us to understand the line of evolution of many invertebrates and vertebrates. Fossil records show that the evolution has taken a gradual process from simple to complex organisms. The origin of modern birds is supported by the evidences from palaeontology.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Archaeopteryx:</b> Archaeopteryx is the oldest known fossil bird. It was an early bird- like form found in the Jurassic period. It is considered to be a connecting link between reptiles and birds. It had wings with feathers, like a bird. It had long tail, clawed digits and conical teeth, like a reptile.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><img src="images/image-308.png" alt="figure 19.4 Archaeopteryx - Fossil bird is shown." class="calibre414"/></p>
	<p class="block_1054">Figure 19.4 Archaeopteryx - Fossil bird</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_598">19.3 Theories of Evolution</h2>
	<p class="block_985">Life had evolved along with evolution of earth towards the end of 18th century. Evolution is the gradual change occurring in living organisms over a period of time. Formation of new species due to changes in specific characters over several generations as response to natural selection, is called evolution. The natural changes occurring is explained through the theories of evolution as proposed by Lamarck and Darwin.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_599">19.3.1 Lamarckism</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Jean Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829) was a French naturalist, well known for his theory of evolution. Lamarck’s theory of evolution was published in ‘Philosophic Zoologies’ in the year 1809. It is popularly known as ‘Theory of inheritance of Acquired Characters” or “Use and Disuse theory” or Lamarckism.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Principles of Lamarckism</p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li class="block_64">Internal vital force</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_1180">Living organisms or their component parts tend to increase in size continuously. This increase in size is due to the inherent ability of the organisms.</p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li value="2" class="block_1055">Environment and new needs</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_1180">A change in the environment brings about changes in the need of the organisms. In response to the changing environment, the organisms develop certain adaptive characters. The adaptations of the organisms may be in the form of development of new parts of the body.</p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li value="3" class="block_1055">Use and disuse theory</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_1180">Lamarck’s use and disuse theory states that if an organ is used constantly, the organ develops well and gets strengthened. When an organ is not used for a long time, it gradually degenerates. The ancestors of giraffe were provided with short neck and short forelimbs. Due to shortage of grass, they were forced to feed on leaves from trees. The continuous stretching of their neck and forelimbs resulted in the development of long neck and long forelimbs which is an example for constant use of an organ. The degenerated wing of Kiwi is an example for organ of disuse.</p>

	<p class="block_2"> </p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li value="4" class="block_64">Theory of Inheritance of acquired characters</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_1197">When there is a change in the environment, the animals respond to the change. They develop adaptive structures. The characters developed by the animals during their life time, in response to the environmental changes are called acquired characters. According to Lamarck, the acquired characters are transmitted to the offspring by the process of inheritance.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_600">19.3.2 Darwinism or Theory of Natural Selection</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Charles Darwin (1809-1882) was one of the great naturalist and philosopher of 18th century. He was born in England in 1809. While studying in college through his friendship with Professor J S Henslow he was fascinated towards nature. At that time the British Admiralty planned a voyage of exploration for 5 years on a ship named H.M.S. Beagle around South America. Dr Henslow was asked to nominate a young naturalist for the voyage. Darwin was given the opportunity. During his five years (1831–1835) voyage he visited many parts of the world, a number of islands including the Galapagos Island and Pacific Island. Darwin made elaborate observations on nature of the land, plants and animals of the regions he visited. He further worked for a period of 20 years to develop the theory of natural selection.</p>
	<p class="block_">Darwin published his observations and conclusions under the name ‘Origin of species’ in 1859. The book of Darwin demonstrates the fact of evolution. It elaborates on the theory of Natural selection for evolutionary transformation,</p>
	<p class="block_12">Principles of Darwinism</p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li class="block_6"><b class="calibre6">Overproduction</b></li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_533">Living beings have the ability to reproduce more individuals and form their own progeny. They have the capacity to multiply in a geometrical manner. This will increase reproductive potential leading to overproduction.</p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li value="2" class="block_7"><b class="calibre6">Struggle for existence</b></li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_1180">Due to over production, a geometric ratio of increase in population occurs. The space to live and food available for the organisms remain the same. This creates an intense competition among the organisms for food and space leading to struggle. The struggle for existence is of three types:</p>
	<ol class="list_2">
	<li class="block_1169"><b class="calibre6">Intraspecific struggle:</b> Competition among the individuals of same species.</li>
	<li class="block_1169"><b class="calibre6">Interspecific struggle</b>: Competition between the organisms of different species living together.</li>
	<li class="block_1169"><b class="calibre6">Environmental struggle</b>: Natural conditions like extreme heat or cold, drought and floods can affect the existence of organisms</li>
</ol>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li value="3" class="block_1055"><b class="calibre6">Variations </b></li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_1180">The occurrence of variation is a characteristic feature of all plants and animals. Small variations are important for evolution. According to Darwin favourable variations are useful to the organism and unfavourable variations are harmful or useless to the organism.</p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li value="4" class="block_1055"><b class="calibre6">Survival of the fittest or Natural selection </b></li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_1197">During the struggle for existence, the organisms which can overcome the challenging situation, survive and adapt to the surrounding environment. Organisms which are unable to face the challenges, are unfit to survive and disappear. The process of selection of organisms with favourable variation is called as natural selection.</p>

	<ol class="list_1">
	<li value="5" class="block_8">Origin of species According to Darwin, new species originates by the gradual accumulation of favourable variations for a number of generations.</li>
</ol>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_601">19.4 Variation</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Sexual reproduction, which involves meiosis helps in recombination of genes during gametic fusion. This leads to differences in the phenotype of the offspring from its parents. These differences are called variation.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Variation is the difference found among individuals of the same species and the offspring of the same parent. Variation is the raw material which plays an important role in evolution. Evolution would not be possible without variation.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Types of variations</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Somatic variation</b>: These are the variations which affect the body (somatic) cells of the organisms. They are not heritable. They occur due to environmental factors.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Germinal variation:</b> These variations are produced in germ cells of an organism. They are inherited. They may be present in ancestors or may occur suddenly. They are classified into two types:</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_64">Continuous variation</li>
	<li class="block_65">Discontinuous variation</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Continuous variation:</b> These are small variations which occur among individuals of a population. They are also called as fluctuating variations. They occur by gradual accumulation in a population. Example  skin colour, height and weight of an individual, colour of eye, etcetera.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Discontinuous variation: </b>These are sudden changes which occur in an organism due to mutations. They do not have any intermediate forms. These large variations are not useful for evolution. </p>
	<p class="block_1054">Example  short legged Ancon sheep, six or more digits (fingers) in human, etcetera.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Discontinuous variation forms the basis for Mutation theory proposed by De Vries.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Relationship between Mutation and Variation</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Mutation and Variation are two events involved in the process of evolution. Mutation arises due to errors occurring in DNA during replication or exposure to UV rays or chemicals. Mutation leads to variation. It brings about changes in a single individual.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_602">19.5 Palaeobotany</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Palaeobotany is derived from Greek words pale on that means “old” and botany the study of plants. It is the branch of palaeontology that deals with recovery and identification of plant remains of geological past.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">A plant fossil is any preserved part of a plant that has died long back. Fossils may be a prehistoric impression that may be hundred to millions of years old. Majority of the plant fossils are disarticulated parts of plants. it is rare to find plants to be preserved as whole.</p>

</ol>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_603">19.5.1 Fossilization</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">The process of formation of fossil in the rocks is called fossilization.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Common methods of fossilization include petrifaction, Molds and cast, carbonization, preservation, compression and infiltration.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Petrifaction</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Minerals like silica slowly penetrate in and replace the original organic tissue and forms a rock like fossil. This method of fossilization can preserve hard and soft parts. Most bones and wood fossils are petrified.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Mold and Cast</p>
	<p class="block_1054">A replica of a plant or animal is preserved in sedimentary rocks. When the organism gets buried in sediment it is dissolved by underground water leaving a hollow depression called a Mold. It shows the original shape but does not reveal the internal structure. Minerals or sediment fill the hollow depression and forms a cast.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Preservation</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Original remains can be preserved in ice or amber (tree sap). They protect the organisms from decay. The entire plant or animal is preserved.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Compression</p>
	<p class="block_1054">When an organism dies, the hard parts of their bodies settle at the bottom of the sea bed and are covered by sediment. The process of sedimentation goes on continuously and fossils are formed.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Infiltration or Replacement</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The precipitation of minerals takes place which later on infiltrate the cell wall. The process is brought about by several mineral elements such as silica, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate. Hard parts are dissolved and replaced by these minerals</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Do you Know </p>
	<p class="block_1054">Living Fossils: These are living organisms that are similar in appearance to their fossilized distant ancestors and usually have no extinct close features. Example Ginkobiloba.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_604">19.5.2 Determination of age of Fossils</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">The age of fossils is determined by radioactive elements present in it. They may be carbon, uranium, lead or potassium. It is used in palaeobotany and anthropology for determining the age of human fossils and manuscripts.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Radioactive carbon(C14) dating method</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><span class="calibre28">This method   was   discovered   by W.F. Libby (1956). Carbon consumption of animals and plants stops after death and since then, only the decaying process of C14 occurs continuously. The time passed since death of a plant or animal can be calculated by measuring the amount of C14. present in their body.</span></p>
	<p class="block_1054">More to Know</p>
	<p class="block_63">What is the Geologic Time Scale?</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The geological time scale is a system of chronological dating that relates geological rock strata to time, and is used by geologists, palaeontologists, and other Earth scientists to describe the timing and relationships of events that have occurred during Earth’s history.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Do you Know </p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Thiruvakkarai fossil wood park (Villupuram district, Tamil Nadu):</b> </p>
	<p class="block_1054">2 million years ago tree trunks that got buried along the river, in course of time the organic matter was replaced by silica and was fossilized. They retained their color, shape and texture and was converted into solid rocks. The annular rings, the texture, colors of the layers, nodes and all properties of plants are still visible.</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_605">19.6 Ethnobotany</h2>
	<p class="block_9">Ethnobotany is the study of a region’s plants and their practical uses through the traditional knowledge of the local culture of people. The term Ethnobotany was coined by J.W. Hershberger in 1895 to include the study of plants used by the primitive and aboriginal people. Though this discipline has existed for ages, ethnobotany emerged as a distinct academic branch of natural science in 20th century.</p>
	<p class="block_9">Aspects of ethnobotany</p>
	<p class="block_9">Ethnobotany has relevance with problems of nutrition, health care and life support system, faith in plants, cottage industries, economic upliftment, conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of plant resources.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Importance of Ethnobotany</p>
	<ul class="list_4">
	<li class="block_66">It provides traditional uses of plant.</li>
	<li class="block_66">It gives information about certain unknown and known useful plants.</li>
	<li class="block_66">The ethnos medicinal data will serve as a useful source of information for the chemists, pharmacologists and practitioners of herbal medicine.</li>
	<li class="block_66">Tribal communities utilize ethnos medicinal plant parts like bark, stem, roots, leaves, flower bud, flowers, fruits, seeds, oils, resins, dyes, gum for the treatment of diseases like diarrhoea, fever, headache, diabetes, jaundice, snakebites, leprosy, etcetera.</li>
</ul>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_606">19.7 Astrobiology or Exobiology </h2>
	<p class="block_">Are we alone in the universe? If your answer is no, then how do you detect the existence of life in space? Astrobiology or exobiology is the science which looks for the presence of extra-terrestrial life in the universe.</p>
	<p class="block_">Astrobiology deals with the origin, evolution and distribution of life in the universe and to investigate the possibility of life in another world.</p>
	<p class="block_">The major concept in astrobiology is the habitable zone. The theory explains that any planets can support the existence of life, if it fulfils two important criteria.</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_6">It must have a right mass to retain an atmosphere.</li>
	<li class="block_8">It must have an orbit at just the right distance from its star (Sun) that it allows liquid water to exist. Thus, the distance needs to be neither too hot or not too cold and is often referred as Goldilocks Zone for life.</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_">In our solar system ‘Earth’ is the only planet in the goldilocks zone. Since, this zone varies at times as the star evolves, we know that Mars have also been habitable. The life on Mars is likely to be the creatures, we find in extreme environments on earth.</p>
	<p class="block_">The organisms which live in extreme environmental conditions on earth are called extremophiles. Thus, within our own Solar System, there are many areas that are different from the Earth where it is probable to find the presence of life similar to extremophile bacteria.</p>

	<ul class="list_4">
	<li class="block_6">Lamarck proposed that the acquired characters are passed on to the off springs in the next generation</li>
	<li class="block_7">Internal vital force, environment and new needs, use and disuse theory and inheritance of acquired characters are the main principles of Lamarckism. </li>
	<li class="block_7">Overproduction, struggle for existence, variations, survival of the fittest or Natural selection and origin of species are the main postulates of Darwinism.</li>
	<li class="block_7">Each species tends to produce large number of off springs, but only the fittest can survive.</li>
	<li class="block_7">Homologous, analogous organs and embryological evidences explain evolutionary relationships.</li>
	<li class="block_7">Some traits in organisms would be similar because they are inherited from a common ancestor.</li>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_619">Introduction</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">India’s population is likely to reach 1.7 billion by 2050. Current rate of India’s food production will be able to meet only 59% of the country’s food demand at that time. How can India feed 1.7 billion people by 2050? This can be made possible by ‘Plant breeding’ and ‘Animal husbandry’.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Plant breeding is the art of developing economically important plants with superior quality.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Animal husbandry involves the breeding of animals. It aims at improving the genotypes of animals to make them more useful to the welfare of mankind. This emphasizes domestication and propagation of animals, under controlled conditions to enhance food production and food quality.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Another breakthrough was the emergence of biotechnology as an entity of modern biology, which paved way to develop advanced healthcare products, diagnostic kits and food production to improve the quality of human life.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_620">20.1 Modern Agricultural Practices and Crop Improvement</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Modern agricultural practices are activities carried out to improve cultivation of plants. It includes preparation of soil, sowing, application of manures and fertilizers, proper irrigation, protection from weeds and pests harvesting, threshing and storage.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The aim of crop improvement is to develop improved crop varieties possessing higher yield, better quality, resistance to diseases and shorter duration.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_621">20.2 Green Revolution</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Green Revolution is the process of increasing food production through high yielding crop varieties and modern agricultural techniques in underdeveloped and developing nations. <b class="calibre6">Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, </b>an American agronomist the <b class="calibre6">“Father of the Green Revolution”,</b> received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. In India <b class="calibre6">Dr. M. S. Swaminathan</b> joined with <b class="calibre6">Dr.Borlaug</b> in bringing Green Revolution by introducing Mexican wheat varieties. This eventually increased wheat and rice production between 1960 and 2000.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_622">20.2.1Breeding for high yield and better quality</h3>
	<p class="block_">Major challenge that India faced during post-independence period was having enough food production for the growing population. Efforts were taken to develop high yielding varieties of crops, leading to Green Revolution.</p>
	<p class="block_">Semi-Dwarf varieties in Wheat and Rice </p>
	<p class="block_">Sonalika, Kalyan Sona are semi-dwarf varieties of wheat developed from high yielding, semi-dwarf, fertilizer responsive wheat varieties from Mexico. IR-8 (Miracle rice) is a high-yielding semi-dwarf rice variety developed by International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippines. In 1966, this was first introduced in Philippines and India. It was a hybrid of a high yielding rice variety Peta from Indonesia, and Dee-geo-woo-gen (DGWG) a dwarf variety from China.</p>

	<p class="block_">Dr. Mankombu Sambasivan Swaminathan is an Indian scientist known for his leading role in India’s Green Revolution. His research on potato, wheat, rice and jute are well known plant breeding experiments. Due to his efforts the wheat production increased from twelve million tonnes in 1960's to seventy million tonnes now. He is aptly called as the “Father of Indian Green Revolution”.</p>

He founded Nammalvar Ecological Foundation for Farm Research and Global Food Security Trust (N E F R G F S T - Vanagam) to create public awareness about the benefits of organic farming.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_623">20.2.2Plant Breeding for Disease Resistance</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Plant diseases are caused by pathogens like viruses, bacteria and fungi. This affects crop yield. Hence, it is important to develop disease resistant varieties of crops, that would increase the yield and reduce the use of fungicides and bactericides. Some disease resistant varieties developed by plant breeding are given below:</p>

	<p class="block_1054">Undernutrition and protein malnutrition among human population is a major health problem which has been receiving much focus throughout the world. Apart from humans, it also affects the health of farm animals. To combat these conditions, human and animal health are to be determined by the nutritional quality of the feed crops. The nutritional quality of crops depends on quality and quantity of nutrients. The nutritional quality may be improved with respect to its</p>

	<p class="block_1054">Methods of plant breeding to develop high yielding varieties are given below:</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_64">Introduction of new varieties of plants</li>
	<li class="block_1055">Selection</li>

	<li class="block_65">Hybridization</li>
</ol>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_627">20.3.1Introduction of New Varieties of Plants</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">It is a process of introducing high yielding varieties of plants from one place to another. Such plants are called as exotic species. These imported plant materials may carry pathogens and pests; hence they are thoroughly tested in a plant quarantine before being introduced to the fields. <b class="calibre6">Example ,</b> Phaseolus mungo was introduced from China.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_628">20.3.2Selection</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Selection is one of the oldest methods of plant breeding in which individual plants or groups of plants are sorted out from a mixed population based on the morphological characters.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Methods of selection</p>
	<p class="block_1054">There are three methods of selection. They are</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_64">Mass selection</li>
	<li class="block_1055">Pure line selection</li>
	<li class="block_65">Clonal selection</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_63">1. </p>
	<p class="block_63">Mass selection</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Seeds of best plants showing desired characters are collected from a mixed population. The collected seeds are allowed to raise the second generation. This process is carried out for seven or eight generations. At the end, they will be multiplied and distributed to the farmers for cultivation.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Some common examples for mass selection are groundnut varieties like TMV–2 and AK–10. Its schematic representation is given below.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><img src="images/image815.jpeg" alt="Mass Selection" class="calibre430"/></p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Figure 20.5</b>Mass Selection</p>
	<p class="block_63">2</p>
	<p class="block_63">Pureline selection</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Pure line is “the progeny of a single individual obtained by self-breeding”. This is also called as individual plant selection. In pure line selection large numbers of plants are selected from a self-pollinated crop and harvested individually.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Individual plant progenies from them are evaluated separately. The best one is released as a pure line variety. Progeny is similar both genotypically and phenotypically.</p>
	<p class="block_63">3</p>
	<p class="block_63">Clonal selection</p>
	<p class="block_1054">A group of plants produced from a single plant through vegetative or asexual reproduction are called clones.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">All the plants of a clone are similar both in genotype and phenotype. Selection of desirable clones from the mixed population of vegetative propagated crop is called clonal selection.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_629">20.3.3Polyploidy Breeding</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Sexually reproducing organisms have two complete set of chromosomes in their somatic cells. This is called diploid (2n). The gametic cells have only one set of chromosomes. This is called haploid (n). An organism having more than two sets of chromosomes is called <b class="calibre6">polyploid</b> </p>
	<p class="block_1054">(In Greek: Polys = many + aploos = one-fold + eidos = form). Such condition is called <b class="calibre6">Polyploidy</b>. It can be induced by <b class="calibre6">physical</b> agents such as heat or cold treatment, X-rays and chemical agents like colchicine.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Achievements of polyploidy breeding</p>
	<p class="block_">Some achievements of polyploidy breeding are</p>
	<div class="calibre10">
	<div class="block_13">a) Seedless watermelons (3n) and bananas (3n).</div>
	<div class="block_13">b) TV-29 (triploid variety of tea) with larger shoots and drought tolerance.</div>
	<div class="block_13">c) Triticale (6n) is a hybrid of wheat and rye. To make this plant fertile polyploidy is induced. It has higher dietary fibre and protein.</div>

</div>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_630">20.3.4Mutation Breeding</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Mutation is defined as the sudden heritable change in the nucleotide sequence of DNA in an organism. It is a process by which genetic variations are created which in turn brings about changes in the organism. The organism which undergoes mutation is called a mutant.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The factors which induce mutations are known as mutagens or mutagenic agents. Mutagens are of two types namely physical mutagens and chemical mutagens.</p>
	<p class="block_63">More to know</p>
	<p class="block_63">Gamma Garden</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Gamma garden or atomic garden is a concept popularised after World War II for the peaceful use of atomic energy for crop improvement. This is a type of induced mutation breeding where radioactive sources particularly gamma rays from Cobalt-60 or Caesium-137 are used to induce desirable mutations in crop plants.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><img src="images/image-322.png" alt="Image displays picture of Gamma Garden" class="calibre431"/></p>

	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_631">20.3.5Hybridization</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Hybridization may be defined as the process of crossing two or more types of plants for bringing their desired characters together into one progeny called hybrid. Hybrid is superior in one or more characters to both parents. Hybridization is the common method of creating genetic variation to get improved varieties.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Hybridization Experiment: Triticale (The first man – made cereal)</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Triticale is the first man- made cereal hybrid. It is obtained by crossing wheat (Triticum durum, 2n = 28) and rye (Secale cereal, 2n = 14). The F1 hybrid is sterile (2n = 21). Then the chromosome number is doubled using colchicine and it becomes a hexaploidy Triticale (2n = 42).</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The cycle of crop raising and selection continues till the plants with the desired characters are finally obtained. The development of new varieties is a long-drawn process. Two main aspects of hybridization are to combine the characters of two plants in one plant and to utilize hybrid vigour.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_632">20.4 Animal Breeding</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">A breed is a group of animals of common origin within a species that has certain distinguishing characters that are not found in other members of the same species like general appearance and others striking features.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Breeding involves mating parents of different varieties each having some desired trait which are passed onto the offspring.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Objectives of Animal Breeding</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Animal breeding aims at improving the genotypes of domesticated animals to increase their yield and improve the desirable qualities to produce milk, egg and meat.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">When breeding takes place between animals of the same breed, it is called inbreeding. The cross between different breeds is called outbreeding.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_633">20.4.1Inbreeding</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Inbreeding refers to the <b class="calibre6">mating of closely related animals within the same breed</b> for about 4-6 generations. Superior males and superior females of the same breed are identified and mated in pairs. It helps in the accumulation of superior genes and elimination of genes which are undesirable.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Hessdalen is a new breed of sheep developed in Punjab by crossing Bikaneri (Magra) ewes and Australian Marino rams.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Inbreeding depression:</b> Continued inbreeding reduces fertility and productivity. Inbreeding exposes harmful recessive genes that are eliminated by selection.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_634">20.4.2Outbreeding</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">It is the breeding of unrelated animals. The off springs formed are called hybrids. The hybrids are stronger and vigorous than their parents. Cross between two different species with desirable features of economic value are mated. Let’s see what cross produce a mule.</p>

	<p class="block_1054">Genetic engineering is the manipulation and transfer of genes from one organism to other organisms to create a new DNA called as recombinant DNA (r DNA). The term recombinant is used because DNA from two different sources can be joined together. Hence, genetic engineering is also called as recombinant DNA technology.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Do you Know</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Plasmid is the small circular double stranded DNA molecule found in the cytoplasm of bacterial cell and separated from chromosomal DNA. It can replicate independently.</p>

</div>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_638">20.5.2 Gene Cloning</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">What reminds to your mind when you hear the word clone? Of course, ‘DOLLY’ the cloned sheep. The carbon copy of an individual is often called a clone. However, more appropriately, a clone means to make a genetically exact copy of an organism.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">In gene cloning, a gene or a piece of DNA fragment is inserted into a bacterial cell where DNA will be multiplied (copied) as the cell divides. A brief outline of the basic steps involved in gene cloning are:</p>
	<ol class="list_3">
	<li class="block_64">Isolation of desired DNA fragment by using restriction enzymes</li>

	<p class="block_">Eli Lilly and Company, United States, in 1979 first started commercial production of human insulin by using rDNA technology.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Gene Therapy</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Gene therapy refers to the replacement of defective gene by the direct transfer of functional genes into humans to treat genetic disease or disorder. The genetic makeup of the ‘patient’ cell is altered using recombinant DNA technology. It was first successfully implemented in 1990.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Somatic genetherapy</b> is the replacement of defective gene in somatic cells.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Germ line genetherapy</b> replacement of defective gene in germ cell (egg and sperm).</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Gene therapy conducted till date has targeted only somatic (non-reproductive) cells. Correction of genetic defects in somatic cells may be beneficial to the patient but the corrected gene may not be carried to the next generation.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_640">20.7 Stem Cells</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Our body is composed of over 200 specialised cell types, that can carry out specific functions. Example  neurons or nerve cell that can transmit signals, or heart cells which contract to pump blood or pancreatic cells to secrete insulin. These specialised cells are called as differentiated cells.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">In contrast to differentiated cells, stem cells are undifferentiated or unspecialised mass of cells. The stem cells are the cells of variable potency. Potency refers to the number of possible fates that a cell can acquire. The two important properties of stem cells that differentiate them from other cells are:</p>
	<ol class="list_3">
	<li class="block_64">its ability to divide and give rise to more stem cells by self-renewal</li>
	<li class="block_65">its ability to give rise to specialised cells with specific functions by the process of differentiation.</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_63">Types of stem cells</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Embryonic stem cells can be extracted and cultured from the early embryos. These cells are derived from the inner cell mass of blastocyst. These cells can be developed into any cell in the body.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Adult stem cell or somatic stem cell are found in the neonatal (new born) and adults. They have the ability to divide and give rise to specific cell types. Sources of adult stem cells are amniotic fluid, umbilical cord and bone marrow.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><span class="calibre28">   </span><img src="images/image-329.png" alt="This picture shows the Differentiation of stem cells " class="calibre439"/></p>

	<p class="block_63">Stem-cell therapy</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Sometimes cells, tissues and organs in the body may be permanently damaged or lost due to genetic condition or disease or injury. In such situations stem cells are used for the treatment of diseases which is called stem-cell therapy. In treating neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease neuronal stem cells can be used to replace the damaged or lost neurons.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_641">20.8 DNA Fingerprinting Technology</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">The human genome has 3 billion base pairs. Did you know that the DNA pattern of two individuals cannot be same except for identical twins. Each person’s DNA sequence is unique due to the small difference in the base pairs. Therefore, if we want to compare the genetic difference among the two individuals, DNA fingerprinting is the easier and quicker method. This technique was developed by Alec Jeffrey.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The technique analyses each individual’s unique DNA sequences and provides distinctive characteristics of individual which helps in identification. Variable number of tandem repeat sequences (VNTR s) serve as molecular markers for identification.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">In human beings, 99 % of the DNA base sequences are the same and this is called as bulk genomic DNA. The remaining 1 % DNA sequence differs from one individual to another. This 1 % DNA sequence is present as small stretch of repeated sequences which is known as satellite DNA. The number of copies of the repeat sequence also called as VNTR s differs from one individual to another, and results in variation in the size of the DNA segment.</p>
	<p class="block_63"><img src="images/image-330.png" alt="This image shows the VNTRs illustration of three persons" class="calibre440"/></p>
	<p class="block_1054">VNTRs illustration of three persons</p>
	<p class="block_1054">As shown in the illustration, the sequence AGCT is repeated six times in first person, five times in second person and seven times in third person. Because of this, DNA segment of third person will be larger in size followed by DNA segment of first person and then the second person. Thus, it is clear that satellite DNA bring about variation within the population. Variation in DNA banding pattern reveals differences among the individuals.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Applications of DNA Fingerprinting</p>
	<ol class="list_3">
	<li class="block_64">DNA fingerprinting technique is widely used in forensic applications like crime investigation such as identifying the culprit. It is also used for paternity testing in case of disputes.</li>
	<li class="block_65">It also helps in the study of genetic diversity of population, evolution and speciation.</li>
</ol>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_642">20.9 Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">One of the most tremendous developments of genetic engineering is the production of genetically modified (GM) plants and animals. Genetic modification refers to the alteration or manipulation of genes in the organisms using rDNA techniques in order to produce the desired characteristics. The DNA fragment inserted is called transgene. Plants or animals expressing a modified endogenous gene or a foreign gene are also known as transgenic organisms.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The transgenic plants are much stable, with improved nutritional quality, resistant to diseases and tolerant to various environment conditions. Similarly, transgenic animals are used to produce proteins of medicinal importance at low cost and improve livestock quality.</p>

	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_656">INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Abuses occur in a variety of forms and are deeply rooted in cultural, social and economic practices. Solving this global problem however requires a much better understanding of its occurrence, causes and consequences with context to sexual and childhood abuse, this is followed by substance abuse. Are people leading healthier lives in today’s modern world than their generations did in the past? For instance, smoking cigarettes, alcohol addiction, use of drugs, eating high fat and cholesterol rich diets, excessive intake of junk foods, reduced physical activity are some of the risk factors for illness and early death. The role of behaviour in health has been receiving increased attention in countries around the world. The health habits of the individuals and their behaviour influence the development of chronic and fatal diseases such as diabetes, obesity, heart disease, cancer and AIDS. These conditions can be substantially reduced by adopting lifestyles that promote wellness and protect their health by taking nutritious diet, regular exercise and by avoiding drugs, alcohol and smoking.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_657">21.1 Abuse and Types of Abuse</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Abuse refers to cruel, violent, harmful or injurious treatment of another human being. It includes physical, emotional or psychological, verbal, child and sexual abuses. Abuse can occur within the family and with people who are not associated with the family. </p>
	<p class="block_1054">These days the use of drugs, alcohol and tobacco has been increasing especially among teenagers and adolescents for adventure, excitement, curiosity and experimentation. </p>
	<p class="block_1054">Let's analyse some of the consequences of sexual and childhood abuse, its prevention and protection.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_658">21.1.1Child Abuse</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Child abuse constitutes all forms of physical or emotional ill treatment, sexual abuse, exploitation resulting in child’s ill health, survival and development. Physical abuse of a child is defined as those acts that cause physical harm such as threatening, beating, kicking and hitting the child.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_659">21.1.2Sexual Abuse</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Sexual harassment is a form of power and dominance of one person over another, which can result in harmful consequence to the victim. It refers to inappropriate or forced sexual contact. Adolescent girls and women encounter sexual harassment in different forms. Sexual abuse is more common at work places. Verbal remarks, comments, gestures and looks are the most common forms of abuse. This results in psychological distress, physical illness and eating disorders in the affected individuals.</p>
	<p class="block_63">More to Know</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The Ministry of Women and Child Development championed the introduction of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012. People who traffic children for sexual purposes are also punishable under the provisions relating to the Act.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><img src="images/image-335.png" alt="This image shows the Logo of POCSO Act 2012" class="calibre445"/></p>
	<p class="block_1054">Objectives of the POCSO Act, 2012</p>
	<ul class="list_4">
	<li class="block_64">To protect children from the offences of</li>
</ul>
	<ul class="list_5">
	<li class="block_1169">Sexual assault</li>
	<li class="block_1169">Sexual harassment</li>
	<li class="block_1169">Pornography</li>
</ul>
	<ul class="list_4">
	<li class="block_65">To establish Special Courts for speedy trial of such offences.</li>
</ul>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_660">21.1.3Child Sexual Abuse</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Children are considered soft targets for sexual abuse because they may not realize that they are being abused. Commonly, abusers are persons well known to the child, may even be living in the same locality. Abusers also bribe (use chocolates and toys) to lure children and take advantage of the child’s innocence.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Sexually abused children show symptoms of genital injury, abdominal pain, frequent urinary infection and behavioural problems.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_661">21.1.4Approaches for Protection of an Abused Child</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Measures adopted for monitoring and assessment of abused child who have undergone signs and symptoms of distress are:</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Child Helpline:</b> The Child Helpline provides a social worker who can assist the child by providing food, shelter and protection.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Counselling the child:</b> Psychologists and social workers should provide guidance, counselling and continuous support to a victimized child.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Family support:</b> The victimized child should be supported by the family members. They should be provided with proper care and attention to overcome their sufferings.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Medical care:</b> A child victim of sexual offences should receive medical care and treatment from health care professionals to overcome mental stress and depression.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Legal Counsel:</b> The family or the guardian of the child victim shall be entitled to free assistance of a legal counsel for such offence.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Rehabilitation:</b> Enrolling in schools and resuming their education is an important step towards rehabilitation of the child. It is essential that the child’s life is gradually returned to normal after the incidence of abuse.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Community based efforts:</b> Conducting awareness campaign on child abuse and its prevention.</p>
	<p class="block_63">More to Know</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) was set up in March 2007 under the Commissions for Protection of Child Rights (CPCR) Act, 2005. This act emphasizes the principle of universality and inviolability of child rights and recognizes the tone of urgency in all the </p>
	<p class="block_1054">child related policies of the country.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Protection of all children of all age group up to 18 years of age is of equal importance. Policies define priority actions for the most vulnerable children.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><img src="images/image-336.png" alt="The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR)" class="calibre446"/></p>
	<p class="block_63">Prevention of child sexual abuse</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The most important social policy proclaimed universally is the prevention of child abuse. Taking steps to prevent childhood sexual abuse is parental and institutional responsibility. Instructions to be given by parents and teachers to the child are.</p>
	<ul class="list_4">
	<li class="block_64">Do not talk to any suspected person or strangers and to maintain a distance.</li>

	<p class="block_1001">AIDS is a severe viral disease and caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). It is a condition in which immune system fails and suppress the body’s disease fighting mechanism. They attack the lymphocytes and the affected individual is prone to infectious diseases.</p>
	<p class="block_1002">Do you Know</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Dr. Suniti Solomon, pioneered HIV research and treatment in India. She set up the first voluntary testing and counsellingcentre and an AIDS Research group in Chennai during 80's. Her team was the first to document evidence of HIV infection in India in 1985 (First Indian AIDS patient in Chennai).</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_692">21.12.1Transmission of HIV</h3>
	<p class="block_1001">AIDS virus has been found in urine, tears, saliva, breast milk and vaginal secretions. The virus is transmitted by an infected patient who comes in contact with blood of a healthy person. H I V or AIDS is not transmitted by touch or any physical contact. It spreads through contact of body fluids or blood.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">HIV is transmitted generally by</p>

	<p class="block_">At the end of this lesson the students will be able to:</p>
	<ul class="list_4">
	<li class="block_6">Differentiate between renewable and non-renewable resources.<span class="tab">      </span></li>
	<li class="block_7">Gain knowledge about the need for conservation of various natural resources.</li>
	<li class="block_7">To know the various methods which can be adopted of conservation of natural resources.</li>
	<li class="block_7">Create awareness about the limited exploitation of natural resources.</li>
	<li class="block_8">Get motivated to participate in the protection of environment and its management.</li>
</ul>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_711">INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Environmental management deals with the different aspects of environment, its structure, function, its quality and its maintenance including conservation of its living and non-living components. The diversified natural resources on this earth provide the necessities for survival of all forms of life including man. Everything that comes from nature has some utility for man but its utilization is possible based on the availability of appropriate technology.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Resources can be renewed simultaneously along with their exploitation (forests, crops, wildlife, groundwater, wind and solar energy). They can maintain themselves by natural recycling or can be replenished by proper management. Simultaneously, non- renewable resources cannot be recycled and can get exhausted by unlimited and continuous use (mineral ores, coal, petroleum etc). They cannot be replaced easily. This would lead to a situation where non-renewable resources may come to an end after a certain period of time.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Expanding human population resulted in expanding needs of man. With scientific and technological advancement man started utilizing natural resources at a much larger scale. Continuous increase in population caused an increased demand for resources. Therefore, conservation of natural resources makes important contributions to the social and economic development of the country.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_712">22.1 Conservation and Judicious Use of Resources</h2>
	<p class="block_1001">Natural resources are conserved for their biological, economic and recreational values. The use of natural resources in excess and unplanned way leads to imbalance in the environment. A judicious balance should be maintained between exploitation of resources and its replenishment. Proper utilization and management of nature and its resources is termed as conservation.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">We have to build a sustainable world, which should last forever. Some of the ways to sustain continuous use of resources are practices to utilise energy efficiently, avoid wastage of water, avoid usage of plastics and other non- biodegradable materials and to take care for the environment we live. It is important that we manage and use our resources carefully so as to preserve for the future generations.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_713">22.2 Forest and its Importance</h2>
	<p class="block_1001">Forests are an important component of our environment and are dominated by microorganisms, flowering plants, shrubs, climbers, dense trees and provide a vast habitat for wild animals. Forests also contribute to the economic development of our country. Forests are vital for human life; it is a source for a wide range of renewable natural resource. They provide wood, food, fodder, fibre and medicine.</p>
	<p class="block_1001">Forests are major factor of environmental concern. They act as carbon sink, regulate climatic conditions, increase rainfall, reduce global warming, prevent natural hazards like flood and landslides, protect wildlife and also act as catchments for water conservation. They also play a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_714">22.2.1Deforestation and its Effects</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Deforestation is the destruction of large area of forests. This happens for many reasons like intensive agriculture, urbanization, construction of dams, roads, buildings and industries, hydroelectric projects, forest fires, construction of mountain and forest roads. It is a threat to the economy, quality of life and future of the environment. India is losing about 1.5 million hectares of forest cover every year.</p>
	<p class="block_63">More to Know </p>
	<p class="block_63">Chipko movement</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The Chipko movement was a non-violent agitation in 1973 that was aimed at protection and conservation of trees. The name of the movement ‘Chipko’ comes from the word ’embrace’, as the villagers hugged the trees and encircled them to prevent them from being cut. The movement originated in the Chamoli district of Uttar Pradesh (now Uttarakhand). The protest of Chipko movement achieved a major victory in 1980 with a 15-year ban on cutting trees in the Himalayan forests.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Effects of Deforestation</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Deforestation gives rise to ecological problems like floods, drought, soil erosion, loss of wild life, extinction of species, imbalance of biogeochemical cycles, alteration of climatic conditions and desertification.</p>

	<p class="block_63">Non-renewable (Exhaustible) energy resources</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Energy obtained from sources that cannot renew themselves over a short period of time is known as non-renewable energy. These are available in limited amount in nature. They include coal, petroleum, natural gas and nuclear power. These conventional energy resources account for 90% of the world’s production of commercial energy and nuclear power account for 10%.</p>
	<p class="block_63">Renewable (Inexhaustible) energy resources</p>
	<p class="block_1054">These energy resources are available in unlimited amount in nature and they can be renewed over a short period of time, inexpensive and can be harvested continuously. These comprise the vast potential of non- conventional energy resources which include biofuel, biomass energy, geothermal energy, water energy (hydroelectric energy and tidal energy), solar energy, wave energy and wind energy.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_724">22.5.1Fossil Fuels</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Fossil fuels are found inside the earth’s crust and are energy rich substances formed by natural process, such as anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms, over millions of years. As the accumulating sediment layers produce heat and pressure, the remains of the organisms are gradually transformed into hydrocarbons. Example petroleum, coal and natural gas.</p>
	<h3 class="block_15" id="toc_id_725">22.5.2Coal and Petroleum</h3>
	<p class="block_1054">Coal and Petroleum are natural resources. They are called fossil fuels as they are formed from the degradation of biomass buried deep under the earth millions of years ago.</p>

	<p class="block_">(a) Pre-screening (b) Aeration (c) Sludge Management and (d) Water Reuse.</p>
	<p class="block_">Pre-screening: Wastewater generated from domestic and industrial activities is screened to remove soil and solid particulates. </p>
	<p class="block_">Aeration: Screened wastewater is then pumped to an aeration tank. Here the microbial contaminants are removed by the biological degradation that occurs in the presence of air. </p>
	<p class="block_">Sedimentation process: In this process, the solid particles in suspension form are allowed to settle. The particles that settle out from the suspension is known as sludge.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Sludge removal:</b> The sludge generated by the degradation process is transferred periodically from the tank for safe disposal.</p>
	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Disinfection:</b> Chlorination and ultraviolet (UV) radiation of treated water is required to remove any microorganism contamination.</p>
	<p class="block_">Water recycling: The water will then be supplied for domestic or industrial purposes.</p>

	<li class="block_6">Differentiate a File from a Folder</li>
	<li class="block_7">Know how to create a File and a Folder</li>
	<li class="block_65">Use the software application to create Animation</li>
</ul>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_753">INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">In general, whenever we think of computers, the things that come to our mind is computer screen, keyboard, mouse and CPU. We learnt about computer and parts of a computer as introductory part in standard 6. Apart from that, software and hardware also play vital role in the working of computer. Now, shall we learn how to operate the computer?</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><img src="images/image-355.png" alt="This image shows the computer" class="calibre467"/></p>
	<p class="block_1054">The reason we prefer computer is its speed and the ability to store data. How can we save data and information in computer? We can save them in folders which accommodate multiple files or a single file. Let us understand the terminologies like file and folder before moving further.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><img src="images/image-356.png" alt="This image shows the various File formats such as Doc, XLS, PPT, PDF, JPG, EPS, PSD,PNG, ZIP, CSS, HTM, MP3, AVI, WAV" class="calibre468"/></p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_754">23.1FILE</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">The output we get from any application is commonly referred as ‘file’ Therefore the application for the specific purposes determines the nature of the file.</p>
	<p class="block_63">23.1.1 FOLDER</p>
	<p class="block_63"><img src="images/image-357.png" alt="This picture shows the Image of the Folder" class="calibre469"/></p>
	<p class="block_1054">A folder is a storage space that contains multiple files. We can create files as per the user’s need. For clear understanding, we can take the example of a bookshelf in a library. The individual book can be considered as a ‘file’ and the whole set of books in a shelf can be considered as folders. When we right click on the mouse, the popup menu appears on the screen with multiple options. Select ‘NEW’ option and a secondary menu comes up with another set of options. Select ‘Folder’ option in the menu. You can now save your file or files in the newly created folder.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">More people are using Windows and LINUX operating systems in their computers. We can do many activities like collect notes, draw or paint, create animations or spreadsheets or word docs or PPTs etcetera.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">We use ‘Guide Board’ to go to the unknown places. </p>

	<p class="block_63">How can we create Files?</p>
	<p class="block_1054">For example if the computer is operating on the Windows OS, we can collect our notes in ‘Notepad’ application and draw pictures in ‘Paint’ application.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">As per its name we can type notes in ‘Notepad’ and save the created files in a folder. Likewise in the ‘Paint’ app we can draw and edit pictures. With these pictures, let us see how we can create image gallery, animations and graphics easily.</p>

	<p class="block_1054"> Pictures and audio-visuals give us more understanding than teaching and writing on the black board. Is it right?</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><img src="images/image340.jpeg" alt="writing on the black board" class="calibre472"/></p>
	<p class="block_1054">Instead of saying a story like ‘once upon a time there was a king’ we can understand the concept easily by seeing the video and also it registers firmly in the minds of the students. The device which helps in explaining the concepts easily through pictures is known as ‘Visual Communication Device’. For example photos, audio -visuals, drawings, animations all these can be created easily with the help of computer. Cinema is a good example for ‘Visual Communication Device’.</p>
	<h2 class="block_5" id="toc_id_755">23.2. SCRATCH</h2>
	<p class="block_1054">Introduction</p>
	<p class="block_1054">‘Scratch’ is a software used to create animations, cartoons and games easily. Scratch is a visual programming language. It was developed in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab to make programming easier and more fun to learn.</p>
	<p class="block_1054">Scratch Environment Editor</p>
	<p class="block_1054">The Scratch editor has three main parts: They are Stage, Sprite and Script editor.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Stage:</b> Stage is the background appearing when we open the scratch window. The background will most often be white. You can change the background colour as you like.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Sprite:</b> The characters on the background of a Scratch window are known as Sprite. Usually a cat appears as a sprite when the Scratch window is opened. The software provides facilities to make alternations in sprite.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><b class="calibre6">Script editor or costume editor:</b> Where you edit your programs or your sprite’s pictures.</p>
	<p class="block_1054"><img src="images/image342.jpeg" alt="Script editor / costume editor: Where you edit your programs or your sprite’s pictures." class="calibre473"/></p>
	<p class="block_1054">You should see a single window with at least the following three panes: the Stage (top left), the Sprite List (bottom left), and the Scripts tab (right), which contains the Blocks tab and the Scripts Area. The right pane also contains two additional tabs, Costumes and Sounds.</p>
	<p class="block_63">The script editor has three main parts:</p>
	<ul class="list_4">
	<li class="block_64">Script area: Where you build scripts.</li>
	<li class="block_1055">Block menu: Where you choose the category of blocks (programming statements) to use.</li>
	<li class="block_65">Block palette: Where you choose the block to use.</li>
</ul>
	<p class="block_">When the Costumes tab is chosen, the costume editor is shown (outlined in red):</p>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image343.jpeg" alt="The costume editor is shown (outlined in red)" class="calibre474"/></p>
	<p class="block_12">Movement and Loops</p>
	<p class="block_">Click File , and click New to create a new project and enter a project name.</p>
	<p class="block_">Click the menu <b class="calibre6">Script → Event, drag a when green flag clicked</b> block to the scripts area. Your scripts area should look like this:</p>

	<p class="block_">Click the green flag at the top right corner of the stage to run your program.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Adding Sound</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_6">Click Sprite1 in the sprite list and click the Sounds tab.</li>
	<li class="block_7">Try the meow sound already there. If you don’t like it, click the speaker icon to choose a different sound from the sound library.</li>

	<p class="block_"><b class="calibre6">Aim</b>: </p>
	<p class="block_">To prove that oxygen is evolved during photosynthesis.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Materials required:</p>
	<p class="block_">Test tube, funnel, beaker, pond water and Hydrilla plant.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Procedure:</p>
	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_6">Take a few twigs of Hydrilla plant in a beaker containing pond water.</li>
	<li class="block_7">Place an inverted funnel over the plant.</li>
	<li class="block_7">Invert a test tube filled with water over the stem of the funnel.</li>

</ol>
	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-372.png" alt="Image shows the PHOTOSYNTHESIS-TEST TUBE AND FUNNEL EXPERIMENT " class="calibre499"/></p>
	<p class="block_12">Observation:</p>
	<p class="block_">After one hour, it is noted that water gets displaced down from the test tube.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Inference</p>
	<p class="block_">During photosynthesis, oxygen is evolved as a by-product. Gas bubbles liberated from the Hydrilla plant reach the top of the test tube and it displaces the water downwards. Take the test tube and keep the burning stick near the mouth of the test tube. Increased flame will appear. Hence, it is proved that oxygen is evolved during photosynthesis.</p>
