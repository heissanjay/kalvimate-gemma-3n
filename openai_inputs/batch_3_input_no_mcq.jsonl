Cubical expansion:\n\nContent:\nIf there is an increase in the volume of a solid body due to heating, then the expansion is calledcubical or volumetric expansion.\nAs in the cases of linear and areal expansion, cubical expansion is also expressed in terms of coefficient of cubical expansion. The ratio of increase in volume of the body per degree rise in temperature to its unit volume is called ascoefficient of cubical expansion. This is also measured in Kelvin ^ - one\nFigure 3. 4 Cubical expansion\nThe equation relating to the change in volume and the change in temperature is given below:\nDeltaV by V o equal to alpha V \u00d7 delta T\nDelta V - Change in volume (Final volume - Initial volume)\nV o - Original volume\nDeltaT - Change in temperature (Final temperature - Initial temperature)\nAlpha V - Coefficient of cubical expansion.\nDifferent materials possess different coefficient of cubical expansion.

The extent of expansion varies from substance to substance. For a given rise in temperature, a liquid will have more expansion than a solid and a gaseous substance has the highest expansion when compared with the other two. The coefficient of cubical expansion of liquid is independent of temperature whereas its value for gases depends on the temperature of gases.\nWhen a liquid is heated, it is done by keeping the liquid in some container and supplying heat energy to the liquid through the container. The thermal energy supplied will be partly used in expanding the container and partly used in expanding the liquid. Thus, what we observe may not be the actual or real expansion of the liquid. Hence, for liquids, we can define real expansion and apparent expansion.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 1 (e.g., 'What is...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation + analogy + unique follow-up question for concept 1.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 2 (e.g., 'Why does...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned reasoning + unique follow-up question for concept 2.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 10.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 10.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The coefficient of cubical expansion of liquid is independent of temperature whereas its value for gases depends on the temperature of gases.\nWhen a liquid is heated, it is done by keeping the liquid in some container and supplying heat energy to the liquid through the container. The thermal energy supplied will be partly used in expanding the container and partly used in expanding the liquid. Thus, what we observe may not be the actual or real expansion of the liquid. Hence, for liquids, we can define real expansion and apparent expansion.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 1 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 1, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 1.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 2 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 2, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 2.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 3 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 3, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 4 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 4, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 5 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 5, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 6 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 6, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 7 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 7, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 8 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 8, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 9 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 9, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 10 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 10, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 10.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Thus, in practice, you can heat any liquid by pouring it in a container. A part of thermal energy is used in expanding the container and a part is used in expanding the liquid. Thus, what you observe is not the actual or real expansion of the liquid. The expansion of a liquid apparently observed without considering the expansion of the container is called the apparent expansion of the liquid.\nCoefficient of apparent expansion is defined as the ratio of the apparent rise in the volume of the liquid per degree rise in temperature to its unit volume.

Mark this level as L1. Now, heat the container and the liquid using a burner as shown in the Figure 3. 5. Initially, the container receives the thermal energy and it expands. As a result, the volume of the liquid appears to have reduced. Mark this reduced level of liquid as L2.\nOn further heating, the thermal energy supplied to the liquid through the container results in the expansion of the liquid. Hence, the level of liquid rises to L3. Now, the difference between the levels L1 and L3 is called asapparent expansion, and the difference between the levels L2 and L3 is called real expansion. The real expansion is always more than that ofapparent expansion.\nFigure 3. 5 Real and apparent expansion of liquid\nReal expansion = L 3 - L 2\nApparent expansion = L 3 - L 1\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

An ideal gas obeys Boyle\u2019s law and Charles\u2019 law and Avogadro\u2019s law.\nAccording to Boyle\u2019s law,\nPV is equal to a constantequation (3. 1)\nAccording to Charles\u2019s law,\nV by T is equal to a constant equation 3. 2\nAccording to Avogadro\u2019s law,\nV by n is equal to a constant equation 3. 3\nAfter combining equations (3. 1), (3. 2) and (3. 3), you can get the following equation.\nPV by n T is equal to constant equation 3. 4\nThe above relation is called the combined law of gases. If you consider a gas, which contains moles of the gas, the number of atoms contained will be equal to \u00d7 the Avogadro number, NA.\nThat is n is equal to mew N A equation 3. 5\nUsing equation (3. 5), equation (3. 4) can be written as\nPV by mew N A T is equal to a constant\nThe value of the constant in the above equation is taken to be k B, which is called as Boltzmann constant (1. 38 \u00d7 10 ^ - 23 joule kelvin ^ - one. Hence, we have the following equation:\nPV by mew N A T is equal to K B\nPV is equal to mew N A K B T\nHere, mew N A k Bis equal to R, which is termed as universal gas constant whose value is 8. 31 joule mole ^ - one kelvin ^ - one.\nPV is equal to RTequation (3. 6)\nIdeal gas equation is also called as equation of state because it gives the relation between the state variables and it is used to describe the state of any gas.\nPoints to Remember\nThe SI unit of heat energy absorbed or evolved is joule (J)\nHeat always flows from a system at higher temperature to a system at lower temperature.\nTemperature is defined as the degree of hotness of a body. The SI unit of temperature is kelvin (K).\nAll the substances will undergo one or more of the following changes when heated:\nTemperature of the substance rises.\nThe substance may change state from solid to liquid or gas.\nThe substance will expand when heated.\nAll forms of matter (solid, liquid and gas) undergo expansion on heating.\nFor a given rise in temperature, a liquid will have more expansion than a solid and a gaseous substance has the highest expansion than the other two.\nIf a liquid is heated directly without using any container, then the expansion that you observe is termed as real expansion of the liquid.\nThe expansion of a liquid apparently observed without considering the expansion of the container is called the apparent expansion of liquid.\nFor a given heat energy, the real expansion is always more than that of apparent expansion.\nIf the atoms or molecules of a gas do not interact with each other, then the gas is said to be an ideal gas or a perfect gas.\nIdeal gas equation, also called as equation of state is PV = RT.

An ideal gas obeys Boyle\u2019s law and Charles\u2019 law and Avogadro\u2019s law.\nAccording to Boyle\u2019s law,\nPV is equal to a constantequation (3. 1)\nAccording to Charles\u2019s law,\nV by T is equal to a constant equation 3. 2\nAccording to Avogadro\u2019s law,\nV by n is equal to a constant equation 3. 3\nAfter combining equations (3. 1), (3. 2) and (3. 3), you can get the following equation.\nPV by n T is equal to constant equation 3. 4\nThe above relation is called the combined law of gases. If you consider a gas, which contains moles of the gas, the number of atoms contained will be equal to \u00d7 the Avogadro number, NA.\nThat is n is equal to mew N A equation 3. 5\nUsing equation (3. 5), equation (3. 4) can be written as\nPV by mew N A T is equal to a constant\nThe value of the constant in the above equation is taken to be k B, which is called as Boltzmann constant (1. 38 \u00d7 10 ^ - 23 joule kelvin ^ - one. Hence, we have the following equation:\nPV by mew N A T is equal to K B\nPV is equal to mew N A K B T\nHere, mew N A k Bis equal to R, which is termed as universal gas constant whose value is 8. 31 joule mole ^ - one kelvin ^ - one.\nPV is equal to RTequation (3. 6)\nIdeal gas equation is also called as equation of state because it gives the relation between the state variables and it is used to describe the state of any gas.\nPoints to Remember\nThe SI unit of heat energy absorbed or evolved is joule (J)\nHeat always flows from a system at higher temperature to a system at lower temperature.\nTemperature is defined as the degree of hotness of a body. The SI unit of temperature is kelvin (K).\nAll the substances will undergo one or more of the following changes when heated:\nTemperature of the substance rises.\nThe substance may change state from solid to liquid or gas.\nThe substance will expand when heated.\nAll forms of matter (solid, liquid and gas) undergo expansion on heating.\nFor a given rise in temperature, a liquid will have more expansion than a solid and a gaseous substance has the highest expansion than the other two.\nIf a liquid is heated directly without using any container, then the expansion that you observe is termed as real expansion of the liquid.\nThe expansion of a liquid apparently observed without considering the expansion of the container is called the apparent expansion of liquid.\nFor a given heat energy, the real expansion is always more than that of apparent expansion.\nIf the atoms or molecules of a gas do not interact with each other, then the gas is said to be an ideal gas or a perfect gas.\nIdeal gas equation, also called as equation of state is PV = RT. Here, R is known as universal gas constant whose value is.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

If you replace the Nichrome wire with a copper wire and conduct the same experiment, you will notice a different current for the same value of the potential difference across the wire. If you again replace the copper wire with an aluminium wire, you will get another value for the current passing through it. From equation (4. 3), you have learnt that Vby I must be equal to the resistance of the conductor used.

A series circuit has only one loop through which current can pass. If the circuit is interrupted at any point in the loop, no current can pass through the circuit and hence no electric appliances connected in the circuit will work. Series circuits are commonly used in devices such as flashlights. Thus, if resistors are connected end to end, so that the same current passes through each of them, then they are said to be connected in series.\nFigure 4. 6 Series connection of resistors\nLet, three resistances R1, R2 and R3 be connected in series (Figure 4. 6). Let the current flowing through them be I. According to Ohm\u2019s Law, the potential differences V1, V2 and V3 across R1, R2 and R3 respectively, are given by:\nV1 = I R1(4. 7)\nV2 = I R2 (4. 8)\nV3 = I R3(4. 9)\nThe sum of the potential differences across the ends of each resistor is given by:\nV = V1 + V2 + V3\nUsing equations (4. 7), (4. 8) and (4. 9), we get V = I R1 + I R2 + I R3(4. 10)\nThe effective resistor is a single resistor, which can replace the resistors effectively, so as to allow the same current through the electric circuit. Let, the effective resistance of the series - combination of the resistors, be RS. Then,\nV = I RS(4. 11)\nCombining equations (4. 10) and (4. 11), you get,\nI RS = I R1 + I R2 + I R3\nRS = R1 + R2 + R3(4. 12)\nThus, you can understand that when a number of resistors are connected in series, their equivalent resistance or effective resistance is equal to the sum of the individual resistances. When \u2018n\u2019 resistors of equal resistance R are connected in series, the equivalent resistance is \u2018n R\u2019.\nTht is, RS is equal to n R\nThe equivalent resistance in a series combination is greater than the highest of the individual resistances.\nSolved Problem5\nThree resistors of resistances 5 ohm. , 3 ohm and 2 ohms are connected in series with 10 V battery. Calculate their effective resistance and the current flowing through the circuit.\nR1 = 5 ohm, R2 = 3 ohm, R3 = 2 ohm, V = 10 Volt\nR s = R1 + R2 + R3, Rs = 5 + 3 + 2 = 10, hence R s = 10 \u03a9\nThe current, I = V by R s equal to ten by ten equal to 1 ampere.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 1 (e.g., 'What is...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation + analogy + unique follow-up question for concept 1.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 2 (e.g., 'Why does...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned reasoning + unique follow-up question for concept 2.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 10.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 10.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

If the circuit is disconnected in one of the loops, the current can still pass through the other loop(s). The wiring in a house consists of parallel circuits.\nFigure 4. 7 Parallel connections of resistors\nConsider that three resistors R1, R2 andR3 are connected across two common points A and B. The potential difference across each resistance is the same and equal to the potential difference between A and B. This is measured using the voltmeter. The current I arriving at A divides into three branches I1, I2 and I3 passing through R1, R2 and R3 respectively.\nAccording to the Ohm\u2019s law, you have,\nI one is equal to V by R one equation 4. 13\nI2 is equal to V by R twoequation 4. 14\nI3 is equal to V by R threeequation 4. 15\nThe total current through the circuit is given by\nI = I 1 + I 2 + I 3\nUsing equations (4. 13), (4. 14) and (4. 15), you get\nI is equal to V by Rone + V by R two + V by R threeequation 4. 16\nLet the effective resistance of the parallel combination of resistors be R p. Then,\nI is equal to V by R p equation 4. 17\nCombining equations (4. 16) and (4. 17), you have\nV by Rp is equal to V by R one + V by R2 + V by R3\nOne by R p = 1 by R 1 + 1 by R 2 + 1 by R 3 equation 4. 18\nThus, when a number of resistors are connected in parallel, the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances is equal to the reciprocal of the effective or equivalent resistance. When \u2018n\u2019 resistors of equal resistances R are connected in parallel, the equivalent resistance is R by n.\nthat is one by R p is equal to one by R + one by R + one by R and so on + 1 by R is equal to n by R\nhence Rp is equal to R by n\nThe equivalent resistance in a parallel combination is less than the lowest of the individual resistances.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 1 (e.g., 'What is...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation + analogy + unique follow-up question for concept 1.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 2 (e.g., 'Why does...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned reasoning + unique follow-up question for concept 2.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 10.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 10.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

If the circuit is disconnected in one of the loops, the current can still pass through the other loop(s). The wiring in a house consists of parallel circuits.\nFigure 4. 7 Parallel connections of resistors\nConsider that three resistors R1, R2 andR3 are connected across two common points A and B. The potential difference across each resistance is the same and equal to the potential difference between A and B. This is measured using the voltmeter. The current I arriving at A divides into three branches I1, I2 and I3 passing through R1, R2 and R3 respectively.\nAccording to the Ohm\u2019s law, you have,\nI one is equal to V by R one equation 4. 13\nI2 is equal to V by R twoequation 4. 14\nI3 is equal to V by R threeequation 4. 15\nThe total current through the circuit is given by\nI = I 1 + I 2 + I 3\nUsing equations (4. 13), (4. 14) and (4. 15), you get\nI is equal to V by Rone + V by R two + V by R threeequation 4. 16\nLet the effective resistance of the parallel combination of resistors be R p.

When \u2018n\u2019 resistors of equal resistances R are connected in parallel, the equivalent resistance is R by n.\nthat is one by R p is equal to one by R + one by R + one by R and so on + 1 by R is equal to n by R\nhence Rp is equal to R by n\nThe equivalent resistance in a parallel combination is less than the lowest of the individual resistances.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 1 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 1, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 1.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 2 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 2, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 2.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 3 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 3, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 4 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 4, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 5 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 5, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 6 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 6, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 7 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 7, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 8 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 8, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 9 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 9, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 10 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 10, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 10.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

What do you observe? The motor casing is warm. This is due to the heating effect of current. The same can be observed by touching a bulb, which was used for a long duration. Generally, a source of electrical energy can develop a potential difference across a resistor, which is connected to that source. This potential difference constitutes a current through the resistor. For continuous drawing of current, the source has to continuously spend its energy. A part of the energy from the source can be converted into useful work and the rest will be converted into heat energy. Thus, the passage of electric current through a wire, results in the production of heat. This phenomenon is called heating effect of current. This heating effect of current is used in devices like electric heater, electric iron, etc. .\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 1 (e.g., 'What is...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation + analogy + unique follow-up question for concept 1.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 2 (e.g., 'Why does...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned reasoning + unique follow-up question for concept 2.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 10.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 10.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

This heating effect of current is used in devices like electric heater, electric iron, etc. .\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Hence, you have\nH = I ^2 R t(4. 20)\nThis is known as Joule\u2019s law of heating.\nJoule\u2019s law of heating states that the heat produced in any resistor is:\ndirectly proportional to the square of the current passing through the resistor.\ndirectly proportional to the resistance of the resistor.\ndirectly proportional to the time for which the current is passing through the resistor.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Electric Heating Device:\nThe heating effect of electric current is used in many home appliances such as electric iron, electric toaster, electric oven, electric heater, geyser, etc. . In these appliances Nichrome, which is an alloy of Nickel and Chromium is used as the heating element. Why? Because:\n(1)it has high resistivity, (2) it has a high melting point, (3) it is not easily oxidized.\n2. Fuse Wire:\nThe fuse wire is connected in series, in an electric circuit. When a large current passes through the circuit, the fuse wire melts due to Joule\u2019s heating effect and hence the circuit gets disconnected. Therefore, the circuit and the electric appliances are saved from any damage. The fuse wire is made up of a material whose melting point is relatively low.\n3. Filament in bulbs:\nIn electric bulbs, a small wire is used, known as filament. The filament is made up of a material whose melting point is very high. When current passes through this wire, heat is produced in the filament. When the filament is heated, it glows and gives out light. Tungsten is the commonly used material to make the filament in bulbs.\nSolved Problem - 6\nAn electric heater of resistance 5 ohm is connected to an electric source.

A larger unit of power, which is more commonly used is kilowatt.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The diagram, which shows the general scheme of a domestic electric circuit, is given in Figure 4. 10In our homes, electricity is distributed through the domestic electric circuits wired by the electricians. The first stage of the domestic circuit is to bring the ^supply to the main - box from a distribution panel, such as a transformer. The important components of the main - box are: (1) a fuse box and (2)a meter. The meter is used to record the consumption of electrical energy. The fuse box contains either a fuse wire or a miniature circuit breaker (MCB). The function of the fuse wire or a MCB is to protect the house hold electrical appliances from overloading due to excess current\nFigure 4. 10 Domestic electric circuit\nYou have learnt about a fuse wire in section4. 8. 2. An MCB is a switching device, which can be activated automatically as well as manually. It has a spring attached to the switch, which is attracted by an electromagnet when an excess current passes through the circuit. Hence, the circuit is broken and the protection of the appliance is ensured. Figure 4. 11 represents a fuse and an MCB.\nFigure 4. 11 A fuse and an MCB\nThe electricity is brought to houses by two insulated wires. Out of these two wires,\none wire has a red insulation and is called the \u2018live wire\u2019. The other wire has a black insulation and is called the \u2018neutral wire\u2019. The electricity supplied to your house is actually an alternating current having an electric potential of 220 Volt. Both, the live wire and the neutral wire enter into a box where the main fuse is connected with the live wire. After the electricity meter, these wires enter into the main switch, which is used to discontinue the electricity supply whenever required. After the main switch, these wires are connected to live wires of two separate circuits. Out of these two circuits, one circuit is of a 5 Ampere rating, which is used to run the electric appliances with a lower ^rating, such as tube lights, bulbs and fans. The other circuit is of a 15 Ampererating, which is used to run electric appliances with ahigh - ^rating, such as air - conditioners, refrigerators, electric iron and heaters. It should be noted that all the circuits in a house are connected in parallel, so that the disconnection of one circuit does not affect the other circuit. One more advantage of the parallel connection of circuits is that each electric appliance gets an equal voltage.\nDo you know?\nIn India domestic circuits are supplied with an alternating current of potential 220 or 230 volt. And frequency 50 hertz. In countries like U S A and U K domestic circuits are supplied with an alternating current of potential of 110 or 120 volt and frequency of 60 hertz.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 1 (e.g., 'What is...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation + analogy + unique follow-up question for concept 1.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 2 (e.g., 'Why does...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned reasoning + unique follow-up question for concept 2.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 10.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 10.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The diagram, which shows the general scheme of a domestic electric circuit, is given in Figure 4. 10In our homes, electricity is distributed through the domestic electric circuits wired by the electricians. The first stage of the domestic circuit is to bring the ^supply to the main - box from a distribution panel, such as a transformer. The important components of the main - box are: (1) a fuse box and (2)a meter. The meter is used to record the consumption of electrical energy. The fuse box contains either a fuse wire or a miniature circuit breaker (MCB). The function of the fuse wire or a MCB is to protect the house hold electrical appliances from overloading due to excess current\nFigure 4. 10 Domestic electric circuit\nYou have learnt about a fuse wire in section4. 8. 2. An MCB is a switching device, which can be activated automatically as well as manually. It has a spring attached to the switch, which is attracted by an electromagnet when an excess current passes through the circuit. Hence, the circuit is broken and the protection of the appliance is ensured. Figure 4. 11 represents a fuse and an MCB.\nFigure 4. 11 A fuse and an MCB\nThe electricity is brought to houses by two insulated wires. Out of these two wires,\none wire has a red insulation and is called the \u2018live wire\u2019. The other wire has a black insulation and is called the \u2018neutral wire\u2019. The electricity supplied to your house is actually an alternating current having an electric potential of 220 Volt. Both, the live wire and the neutral wire enter into a box where the main fuse is connected with the live wire. After the electricity meter, these wires enter into the main switch, which is used to discontinue the electricity supply whenever required. After the main switch, these wires are connected to live wires of two separate circuits. Out of these two circuits, one circuit is of a 5 Ampere rating, which is used to run the electric appliances with a lower ^rating, such as tube lights, bulbs and fans. The other circuit is of a 15 Ampererating, which is used to run electric appliances with ahigh - ^rating, such as air - conditioners, refrigerators, electric iron and heaters. It should be noted that all the circuits in a house are connected in parallel, so that the disconnection of one circuit does not affect the other circuit. One more advantage of the parallel connection of circuits is that each electric appliance gets an equal voltage.\nDo you know?\nIn India domestic circuits are supplied with an alternating current of potential 220 or 230 volt. And frequency 50 hertz. In countries like U S A and U K domestic circuits are supplied with an alternating current of potential of 110 or 120 volt and frequency of 60 hertz.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

This results in heating of wires to such an extent that a fire may be caused in the building.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

An LED TV is actually an LCD TV (Liquid Crystal Display) with LED display. An LED display uses LEDs for backlight and an array of LEDs act as pixels. LEDs emitting white light are used in monochrome (black and white) TV; Red, Green and Blue (RGB) LEDs are used in colour television. The first LED television screen was developed by James. Mitchell in 1977. It was a monochromatic display. But, after about three decades, in 2009, SONY introduced the first commercial LED Television.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

How does sound reach our ears from various sources? What is sound? Is it a force or energy? Let us answer all these questions.\nFigure 5. 1 Production of sound waves\nBy touching a ringing bell or a musical instrument while it is producing music, you can conclude that sound is produced by vibrations. The vibrating bodies produce energy in the form of waves, which are nothing but sound waves (Figure 5. 1). Suppose you and your friend are on the Moon. Will you be able to hear any sound produced by your friend? As the Moon does not have air, you will not be able to hear any sound produced by your friend. Hence, you understand that the sound produced due to the vibration of different bodies needs a material medium like air, water, steel, etc. , for its propagation. Hence, sound can propagate through a gaseous medium or a liquid medium or a solid medium.\nTake a squeaky toy or old mobile phone and put it inside a plastic bag. Seal the bag with the help of a candle or with a thread. Fill a bucket with water and place the bag in the water bucket and squeeze the toy or ring the mobile. You will hear a low sound. Now place your ear against the side of the bucket and squeeze the toy or ring the mobile phone again. You will hear a louder sound.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 1 (e.g., 'What is...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation + analogy + unique follow-up question for concept 1.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 2 (e.g., 'Why does...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned reasoning + unique follow-up question for concept 2.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 10.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 10.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Elastic property of solids is characterized by their elastic moduli. The speed of sound is directly proportional to the square root of the elastic modulus and inversely proportional to the square root of the density. Thus, the velocity of sound in solids decreases as the density increases whereas the velocity of sound increases when the elasticity of the material increases. In the case of gases, the following factors affect the velocity of sound waves.\nEffect of density: The velocity of sound in a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of the density of the gas. Hence, the velocity decreases as the density of the gas increases.\nV is proportional to square root of one by d\nEffect of temperature: The velocity of sound in a gas is directly proportional to the square root of its temperature. The velocity of sound in a gas increase with the increase in temperature. V\u221d\u221aT. Velocity at temperature T is given by the following equation:\nV T = (v 0 + 0. 61 T) meter second ^ - one. VT is equal to V0 + zero point six one T with in the bracket metre second ^ - one\nHere, V 0 is the velocity of sound in the gas at 0\u00b0 C. For air, V 0 = 331 meter second ^ - one. Hence, the velocity of sound changes by 0. 61 metre second ^ - one when the temperature changes by one degree Celsius.\nEffect of relative humidity: When humidity increases, the speed of sound increases. That is why you can hear sound from long distances clearly during rainy seasons.\nSpeed of sound waves in different media are given in table 5. 1\nTable 5. 1 Speed of sound in different media\nof the medium\nName of the Medium\nSpeed of sound(in meter second ^ - one)\nAir (at 0degree Celsius)\nAir (at 20degree celsius)\nExample Problem 5. 1\n1.

Let V 1and V 2 be the velocity of sound at temperatures\nT 1 Kelvin and T 2 kelvin respectively. T 1 = 273 Kelvin (0 degree celsius) and T 2 = (T degree Celsius + 273) Kelvin\nV 2 by V 1 = square root of T 2 by T 1 = square root of 273 + T / square root of 273 = 2\nHere it is given that V 2 by V 1 = 2\nSo, 273 + T / 273 = 4\nT = (273 \u00d7 4) - 273 = 819degree Celsius.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 1 (e.g., 'What is...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation + analogy + unique follow-up question for concept 1.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 2 (e.g., 'Why does...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned reasoning + unique follow-up question for concept 2.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 10.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 10.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

VT is equal to V0 + zero point six one T with in the bracket metre second ^ - one\nHere, V 0 is the velocity of sound in the gas at 0\u00b0 C. For air, V 0 = 331 meter second ^ - one. Hence, the velocity of sound changes by 0. 61 metre second ^ - one when the temperature changes by one degree Celsius.\nEffect of relative humidity: When humidity increases, the speed of sound increases. That is why you can hear sound from long distances clearly during rainy seasons.\nSpeed of sound waves in different media are given in table 5. 1\nTable 5. 1 Speed of sound in different media\nof the medium\nName of the Medium\nSpeed of sound(in meter second ^ - one)\nAir (at 0degree Celsius)\nAir (at 20degree celsius)\nExample Problem 5. 1\n1.

Elastic property of solids is characterized by their elastic moduli. The speed of sound is directly proportional to the square root of the elastic modulus and inversely proportional to the square root of the density. Thus, the velocity of sound in solids decreases as the density increases whereas the velocity of sound increases when the elasticity of the material increases. In the case of gases, the following factors affect the velocity of sound waves.\nEffect of density: The velocity of sound in a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of the density of the gas. Hence, the velocity decreases as the density of the gas increases.\nV is proportional to square root of one by d\nEffect of temperature: The velocity of sound in a gas is directly proportional to the square root of its temperature. The velocity of sound in a gas increase with the increase in temperature. V\u221d\u221aT. Velocity at temperature T is given by the following equation:\nV T = (v 0 + 0. 61 T) meter second ^ - one.

Hence, the velocity of sound changes by 0. 61 metre second ^ - one when the temperature changes by one degree Celsius.\nEffect of relative humidity: When humidity increases, the speed of sound increases. That is why you can hear sound from long distances clearly during rainy seasons.\nSpeed of sound waves in different media are given in table 5. 1\nTable 5. 1 Speed of sound in different media\nof the medium\nName of the Medium\nSpeed of sound(in meter second ^ - one)\nAir (at 0degree Celsius)\nAir (at 20degree celsius)\nExample Problem 5. 1\n1.

Let V 1and V 2 be the velocity of sound at temperatures\nT 1 Kelvin and T 2 kelvin respectively. T 1 = 273 Kelvin (0 degree celsius) and T 2 = (T degree Celsius + 273) Kelvin\nV 2 by V 1 = square root of T 2 by T 1 = square root of 273 + T / square root of 273 = 2\nHere it is given that V 2 by V 1 = 2\nSo, 273 + T / 273 = 4\nT = (273 \u00d7 4) - 273 = 819degree Celsius.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

This is nothing but the reflection of the sound waves that you produce. Let us discuss about the reflection of sound in detail through the following activity.\nWhen sound waves travel in a given medium and strike the surface of another medium, they can be bounced back into the first medium. This phenomenon is known as reflection. In simple the reflection and refraction of sound is actually similar to the reflection of light. Thus, the bouncing of sound waves from the interface between two media is termed as the reflection of sound.

The following two laws of reflection are applicable to sound waves as well.\nThe incident wave, the normal to the reflecting surface and the reflected wave at the point of incidence lie in the same plane.\nThe angle of incidence\u2220i is equal to the angle of reflection\u2220r.\nThese laws can be observed from Figure 5. 4.\nFigure 5. 4 Laws of reflection\nIn the above Figure 5. 4, the sound waves that travel towards the reflecting surface are called the incident waves. The sound waves bouncing back from the reflecting surface are called reflected waves. For all practical purposes, the point of incidence and the point of reflection is the same point on the reflecting surface.\nA perpendicular line drawn at the point of incidence is called the normal. The angle which the incident sound wave makes with the normal is called the angle of incidence, \u2018i\u2019.

Suppose a compression travelling in air from left to right reaches a rigid wall. The compression exerts a force F on the rigid wall. In turn, the wall exerts an equal and opposite reaction R = - F on the air molecules. This results in a compression near the rigid wall. Thus, a compression travelling towards the rigid wall is reflected back as a compression. That is the direction of compression is reversed (Figure 5. 5).\nFigure 5. 5 Reflection of sound at a denser medium\nConsider a wave travelling in a solid medium striking on the interface between the solid and the air. The compression exerts a force F on the surface of the rarer medium. As a rarer medium has smaller resistance for any deformation, the surface of separation is pushed backwards (Figure 5. 6). As the particles of the rarer medium are free to move, a rarefaction is produced at the interface. Thus, a compression is reflected as a rarefaction and a rarefaction travel from right to left.\nFigure 5. 6 Reflection of sound at a rarer medium\nMore to know:\nWhat is meant by rarer and denser medium?

Suppose a compression travelling in air from left to right reaches a rigid wall. The compression exerts a force F on the rigid wall. In turn, the wall exerts an equal and opposite reaction R = - F on the air molecules. This results in a compression near the rigid wall. Thus, a compression travelling towards the rigid wall is reflected back as a compression. That is the direction of compression is reversed (Figure 5. 5).\nFigure 5. 5 Reflection of sound at a denser medium\nConsider a wave travelling in a solid medium striking on the interface between the solid and the air. The compression exerts a force F on the surface of the rarer medium. As a rarer medium has smaller resistance for any deformation, the surface of separation is pushed backwards (Figure 5. 6). As the particles of the rarer medium are free to move, a rarefaction is produced at the interface. Thus, a compression is reflected as a rarefaction and a rarefaction travel from right to left.\nFigure 5. 6 Reflection of sound at a rarer medium\nMore to know:\nWhat is meant by rarer and denser medium? The medium in which the velocity of sound increases compared to another medium is called rarer medium. (Water is rarer compared to air for sound).\nThe medium in which the velocity of sound decreases compared to another medium is called denser medium. (Air is denser compared to water for sound)\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

When reflected from a convex surface, the reflected waves are diverged out and the intensity is decreased.

Parabolic surfaces are used when it is required to focus the sound at a particular point. Hence, many halls are designed with parabolic reflecting surfaces. In elliptical surfaces, sound from one focus will always be reflected to the other focus, no matter where it strikes the wall.\nThis principle is used in designing whispering halls.

The intensity of the reflected wave is neither decreased nor increased. But, when the sound waves are reflected from the curved surfaces, the intensity of the reflected waves is changed. When reflected from a convex surface, the reflected waves are diverged out and the intensity is decreased. When sound is reflected from a concave surface, the reflected waves are converged and focused at a point So the intensity of reflected waves is concentrated at a point. Parabolic surfaces are used when it is required to focus the sound at a particular point. Hence, many halls are designed with parabolic reflecting surfaces. In elliptical surfaces, sound from one focus will always be reflected to the other focus, no matter where it strikes the wall.\nThis principle is used in designing whispering halls. In a whispering hall, the speech of a person standing in one focus can be heard clearly by a listener standing at the other focus.\nDo You Know?\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The sound, which you hear is called an echo. It is due to the reflection of sound. One does not experience any echo sound in a small room. This does not mean that sound is not reflected in a small room. This is because smaller rooms do not satisfy the basic conditions for hearing an echo.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

If you consider the velocity of sound as 344theminimum distance required to hear an echo is 17. 2 m.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Measure the distance \u2018d\u2019 between the source of sound pulse and the reflecting surface using the measuring tape.\n2. The receiver is also placed adjacent to the source. A sound pulse is emitted by the source.\n3. The stopwatch is used to note the time interval between the instant at which the sound pulse is sent and the instant at which the echo is received by the receiver. Note the time interval as \u2018t\u2019.\n4. Repeat the experiment for three or four \u00d7 . The average time taken for the given number of pulses is calculated.\nCalculation of speed of sound:\nThe sound pulse emitted by the source travels a total distance of 2d while travelling from the source to the wall and then back to the receiver. The time taken for this has been observed to be \u2018t\u2019.

Sound board\nThese are basically curved surfaces (concave), which are used in auditoria and halls to improve the quality of sound. This board is placed such that the speaker is at the focus of the concave surface. The sound of the speaker is reflected towards the audience thus improving the quality of sound heard by the audience.\n5. 4. 2. Ear trumpet\nEar trumpet is a hearing aid, which is useful by people who have difficulty in hearing. In this device, one end is wide, and the other end is narrow. The sound from the sources falls into the wide end and are reflected by its walls into the narrow part of the device. This helps in concentrating the sound and the sound enters the ear drum with more intensity. This enables a person to hear the sound better.\n5. 4. 3.

This apparent change in frequency was first observed and explained by Christian Doppler (1803to1853), an Austrian Mathematician and Physicist. He observed that the frequency of the sound as received by a listener is different from the original frequency produced by the source whenever there is a relative motion between the source and the listener. This is known as Doppler effect This relative motion could be due to various possibilities as follows:\nThe listener moves towards or away from a stationary source\nThe source moves towards or away from a stationary listener\nBoth source and listener move towards or away from one other\nThe medium moves when both source and listener are at rest\nWhenever there is a relative motion between a source and a listener, the frequency of the sound heard by the listener is different from the original frequency of sound emitted by the source. This is known as \u201cDoppler effect\u201d.\nFigure 5. 7 Source and listener moving towards each other\nFor simplicity of calculation, it is assumed that the medium is at rest. That is the velocity of the medium is zero. Let S and L be the source and the listener moving with velocities vSand vLrespectively. Consider the case of source and listener moving towards each other (Figure 5. 7). As the distancebetween them decreases, the apparent frequency will be more than the actual source frequency.\nLet n and n dashbe the frequency of the sound produced by the source and the sound observed by the listener respectively.

He observed that the frequency of the sound as received by a listener is different from the original frequency produced by the source whenever there is a relative motion between the source and the listener. This is known as Doppler effect This relative motion could be due to various possibilities as follows:\nThe listener moves towards or away from a stationary source\nThe source moves towards or away from a stationary listener\nBoth source and listener move towards or away from one other\nThe medium moves when both source and listener are at rest\nWhenever there is a relative motion between a source and a listener, the frequency of the sound heard by the listener is different from the original frequency of sound emitted by the source.

This apparent change in frequency was first observed and explained by Christian Doppler (1803to1853), an Austrian Mathematician and Physicist. He observed that the frequency of the sound as received by a listener is different from the original frequency produced by the source whenever there is a relative motion between the source and the listener. This is known as Doppler effect This relative motion could be due to various possibilities as follows:\nThe listener moves towards or away from a stationary source\nThe source moves towards or away from a stationary listener\nBoth source and listener move towards or away from one other\nThe medium moves when both source and listener are at rest\nWhenever there is a relative motion between a source and a listener, the frequency of the sound heard by the listener is different from the original frequency of sound emitted by the source. This is known as \u201cDoppler effect\u201d.\nFigure 5. 7 Source and listener moving towards each other\nFor simplicity of calculation, it is assumed that the medium is at rest. That is the velocity of the medium is zero. Let S and L be the source and the listener moving with velocities vSand vLrespectively. Consider the case of source and listener moving towards each other (Figure 5. 7). As the distancebetween them decreases, the apparent frequency will be more than the actual source frequency.\nLet n and n dashbe the frequency of the sound produced by the source and the sound observed by the listener respectively. Then, the expression for the apparent frequency n' is\nn \u2014 is equal to v + v1 by v - vs into n\nHere, v is the velocity of sound waves in the given medium. Let us consider different possibilities of motions of the source and the listener. In all such cases, the expression for the apparent frequency is given in table 5. 2.\nTable 5. 2 Expression for apparent frequency due to Doppler effect\nCase Number.\nPosition of source and listener\nExpression for apparent frequency\nBoth source and listener move\nThey move towards each other\na)Distance between source and listener decreases. b)Apparent frequency is more than actual frequency.\na)Distance between source and listener decreases.\nb)Apparent frequency is more than actual frequency.\nN \u2014 equal to v + v1 / v - vs in to n\nBoth source and listener move\nThey move away from each other\na)Distance between source and listener increases. b)Apparent frequency is less than actual frequency. c)vSandLbecome opposite to that in case1.\na)Distance between source and listener increases.\nb)Apparent frequency is less than actual frequency.\nc)vSandLbecome opposite to that in case1.\nN dahs equal to v - v1 by v + vs in to n\nBoth source and listener move\nThey move one behind the other\nSource follows the listener\na)Apparent frequency depends on the velocities of the source and the listener. b)vSbecomes opposite to that in case2.\na)Apparent frequency depends on the velocities of the source and the listener.\nb)vSbecomes opposite to that in case2.\nN dah equal to v - v1 by v - vs into n\nBoth source and listener move\nThey move one behind the other\nListener follows the source\na)Apparent frequency depends on the velocities of the source and the listener. b)vSand vLbecome opposite to that in case3.\na)Apparent frequency depends on the velocities of the source and the listener.\nb)vSand vLbecome opposite to that in case3.\nN \u2014 is equal to v + v1 by v + vs into n\nSource at rest Listener moves towards the source\na)Distance between source and listener decreases. b)Apparent frequency is more than actual frequency. c)vS = 0 incase1.\na)Distance between source and listener decreases.\nb)Apparent frequency is more than actual frequency.\nc)vS = 0 incase1.\nN \u2014 is equal to v + v1 by v into n\nSource at rest Listener moves away from the source\na)Distance between source and listener increases. b)Apparent frequency is less than actual frequency. c)vS = 0 incase2.\na)Distance between source and listener increases.\nb)Apparent frequency is less than actual frequency.\nc)vS = 0 incase2.\nN \u2014 is equal to v - v1 by v into n\nListener at rest\nSource moves towards the listener\na)Distance between source and listener decreases. b)Apparent frequency is more than actual frequency. c)vL = 0 incase1.\na)Distance between source and listener decreases.\nb)Apparent frequency is more than actual frequency.\nc)vL = 0 incase1.\nN \u2014 is equal to v by v - vs into n\nListener at rest Source moves away from the listener\na)Distance between source and listener increases. b)Apparent frequency is less than actual frequency. c)vL = 0 incase2.\na)Distance between source and listener increases.\nb)Apparent frequency is less than actual frequency.\nc)vL = 0 incase2.\nN \u2014 is equal to v by v + vs into n\nSuppose the medium (say wind) is moving with a velocity W in the direction of the propagation of sound. For this case, the velocity of sound, \u2018v\u2019 should be replaced with (v + W). If the medium moves in a direction opposite to the propagation of sound, then \u2018v\u2019 should be replaced with (v - W).\nSolved problems\n1.

Things around us are made up of atoms. A Greek Philosopher 'Democritus' in 400 BC believed that matter is made up of tiny indestructible units called atoms. Later, in 1803, John Dalton considered that elements consist of atoms, which are identical in nature. J J Thomson discovered cathode rays, known as electrons, experimentally and Goldstein discovered positive rays, which were named as protons by Rutherford. In 1932, James Chadwick discovered the charge less particles called neutrons. Presently, a large number of elementary particles like photon, meson, positron and neutrino have been discovered. In 1911, the British scientist, Ernest Rutherford explained that the mass of an atom is concentrated in its central part called Nucleus.

By chance, an unexposed photographic plate was also stored in the same drawer. After a week he returned and noticed that the film had been exposed to some radiation. He discovered that he could reproduce the effect whenever he placed uranium near a photographic film. Apparently, uranium radiated something that could affect a photographic plate. This phenomenon was called as Radioactivity. Uranium was identified to be a radioactive element.\nTwo years later, the Polish physicist Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie detected radioactivity in 'Pitchblende', a tiny black substance. They were not surprised at the radioactivity of pitchblende, which is known as an ore of uranium. Later, they discovered that the radiation was more intense from pure uranium. Also, it was found that the pitchblende had less concentration of uranium. Theyconcluded that some other substance was present in pitchblende. After separating this new substance, they discovered that it had unknown chemical properties and it also emitted radiations spontaneously like uranium. They named this new substance as 'Radium'. The radioactive elements emit harmful radioactive radiations like alpha rays or beta rays or gamma rays.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 1 (e.g., 'What is...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation + analogy + unique follow-up question for concept 1.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 2 (e.g., 'Why does...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned reasoning + unique follow-up question for concept 2.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 10.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 10.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

By chance, an unexposed photographic plate was also stored in the same drawer. After a week he returned and noticed that the film had been exposed to some radiation. He discovered that he could reproduce the effect whenever he placed uranium near a photographic film. Apparently, uranium radiated something that could affect a photographic plate. This phenomenon was called as Radioactivity. Uranium was identified to be a radioactive element.\nTwo years later, the Polish physicist Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie detected radioactivity in 'Pitchblende', a tiny black substance. They were not surprised at the radioactivity of pitchblende, which is known as an ore of uranium. Later, they discovered that the radiation was more intense from pure uranium. Also, it was found that the pitchblende had less concentration of uranium. Theyconcluded that some other substance was present in pitchblende. After separating this new substance, they discovered that it had unknown chemical properties and it also emitted radiations spontaneously like uranium. They named this new substance as 'Radium'. The radioactive elements emit harmful radioactive radiations like alpha rays or beta rays or gamma rays.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Such nuclei undergo nuclear decay and get converted into more stable nuclei. During this nuclear reaction, these nuclei emit certain harmful radiations and elementary particles. The phenomenon of nuclear decay of certain elements with the emission of radiations like alpha, beta, and gamma rays is called 'radioactivity' and the elements, which undergo this phenomenon are called 'radioactive elements'.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

These three neutrons in turn can cause fission in three other uranium nuclei present in the sample, thus producing nine neutrons. These nine neutrons in turn may produce twenty - seven neutrons and so on. This is known as 'chain reaction'. A chain reaction is a self - propagating process in which the number of neutrons goes on multiplying rapidly almost in a geometrical progression.\nTwo kinds of chain reactions are possible. They are: (One) controlled chain reaction and (Two)uncontrolled chain reaction.\n(a)Controlled chain reaction\n(a)Controlled chain reaction\nIn the controlled chain reaction, the number of neutrons released is maintained to be one. This is achieved by absorbing the extra neutrons with a neutron absorber leaving only one neutron to produce further fission. Thus, the reaction is sustained in a controlled manner. The energy released due to a controlled chain reaction can be utilized for constructive purposes. Controlled chain reaction is used in a nuclear reactor to produce energy in a sustained and controlled manner.\n(b) Uncontrolled chain reaction\nIn the uncontrolled chain reaction, the number of neutrons multiplies indefinitely and causes fission in a large amount of the fissile material. This results in the release of a huge amount of energy within a fraction of a second. This kind of chain reaction is used in the atom bomb to produce an explosion. Figure 6. 3 represents an uncontrolled chain reaction.\nFigure 6. 3 Uncontrolled chain reaction\n6. 3. 4 Critical Mass\nDuring a nuclear fission process, about 2 to 3 neutrons are released. But all these neutrons may not be available to produce further fission. Some of them may escape from the system, which is termed as 'leakage of neutrons' and some may be absorbed by the non - fissionable materials present in the system. These two factors lead to the loss of neutrons. To sustain the chain reaction, the rate of production of neutrons due to nuclear fission must be more than the rate of its loss. This can be achieved only when the size (That is mass) of the fissionable material is equal to a certain optimum value. This is known as 'critical mass'.\nThe minimum mass of a fissile material necessary to sustain the chain reaction is called' critical mass (mc)'. It depends on the nature, density and the size of the fissile material.\nIf the mass of the fissile material is less than the critical mass, it is termed as 'subcritical'. If the mass of the fissile material is more than the critical mass, it is termed as 'supercritical'.\nActivity 6. 2\nUsing beads make a chain reaction model\n6. 3. 5 Atom bomb\nThe atom bomb is based on the principle of uncontrolled chain reaction. In an uncontrolled chain reaction, the number of neutrons and the number of fission reactions multiply almost in a geometrical progression. This releases a huge amount of energy in a very small - time interval and leads to an explosion.\nAn atom bomb consists of a piece of fissile material whose mass is subcritical. This piece has a cylindrical void. It has a cylindrical fissile material which can fit into this void and its mass is also subcritical. When the bomb has to be exploded, this cylinder is injected into the void using a conventional explosive. Now, the two pieces of fissile material join to form the supercritical mass, which leads to an explosion. The structure of an atom bomb is shown in Figure 6. 4\nFigure 6. 4 Atom bomb\nDuring this explosion tremendous amount of energy in the form of heat, light and radiation is released. A region of very high temperature and pressure is formed in a fraction of a second along with the emission of hazardous radiation like \u03b3 rays, which adversely affect the living creatures. This type of atom bombs was exploded in 1945 at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan during the World War II.\nDo You Know?\nElectron Volt it read as eV is the unit used in nuclear physics to measure the energy of small particles.

Controlled chain reaction is used in a nuclear reactor to produce energy in a sustained and controlled manner.\n(b) Uncontrolled chain reaction\nIn the uncontrolled chain reaction, the number of neutrons multiplies indefinitely and causes fission in a large amount of the fissile material. This results in the release of a huge amount of energy within a fraction of a second. This kind of chain reaction is used in the atom bomb to produce an explosion. Figure 6. 3 represents an uncontrolled chain reaction.\nFigure 6. 3 Uncontrolled chain reaction\n6. 3. 4 Critical Mass\nDuring a nuclear fission process, about 2 to 3 neutrons are released. But all these neutrons may not be available to produce further fission. Some of them may escape from the system, which is termed as 'leakage of neutrons' and some may be absorbed by the non - fissionable materials present in the system. These two factors lead to the loss of neutrons. To sustain the chain reaction, the rate of production of neutrons due to nuclear fission must be more than the rate of its loss. This can be achieved only when the size (That is mass) of the fissionable material is equal to a certain optimum value. This is known as 'critical mass'.\nThe minimum mass of a fissile material necessary to sustain the chain reaction is called' critical mass (mc)'. It depends on the nature, density and the size of the fissile material.\nIf the mass of the fissile material is less than the critical mass, it is termed as 'subcritical'. If the mass of the fissile material is more than the critical mass, it is termed as 'supercritical'.\nActivity 6. 2\nUsing beads make a chain reaction model\n6. 3. 5 Atom bomb\nThe atom bomb is based on the principle of uncontrolled chain reaction. In an uncontrolled chain reaction, the number of neutrons and the number of fission reactions multiply almost in a geometrical progression. This releases a huge amount of energy in a very small - time interval and leads to an explosion.\nAn atom bomb consists of a piece of fissile material whose mass is subcritical. This piece has a cylindrical void. It has a cylindrical fissile material which can fit into this void and its mass is also subcritical. When the bomb has to be exploded, this cylinder is injected into the void using a conventional explosive. Now, the two pieces of fissile material join to form the supercritical mass, which leads to an explosion. The structure of an atom bomb is shown in Figure 6. 4\nFigure 6. 4 Atom bomb\nDuring this explosion tremendous amount of energy in the form of heat, light and radiation is released. A region of very high temperature and pressure is formed in a fraction of a second along with the emission of hazardous radiation like \u03b3 rays, which adversely affect the living creatures. This type of atom bombs was exploded in 1945 at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan during the World War II.\nDo You Know?\nElectron Volt it read as eV is the unit used in nuclear physics to measure the energy of small particles.

If nuclear fusion is a spontaneous process at normal temperature and pressure, then a number of fusion processes would happen in the atmosphere which may lead to explosions. But we do not encounter any such explosions. Can you explain why?\nThe answer is that nuclear fusion can take place only under certain conditions.\nNuclear fusion is possible only at an extremely high temperature of the order of 10 ^of 7 to\n10 ^of 9 Kelvin and a high pressure to push the hydrogen nuclei closer to fuse with each other.

The first nuclear reactor was built in 1942 at Chicago, USA.\n6. 7. 1 Types of nuclear reactors\nBreeder reactor, fast breeder reactor, pressurized water reactor, pressurized heavy water reactor, boiling water reactor, water - cooled reactor, gas - cooled reactor, fusion reactor and thermal reactor are some types of nuclear reactors, which are used in different places world - wide.\n6. 7. 2 Components of a nuclear reactors\nThe essential components of a nuclear reactor are (1) fuel, (2) moderator, (3) control rod, (4) coolant and (5) protection wall.\nFirst is. Fuel: A fissile material is used as the fuel. The commonly used fuel material is uranium.\nSecond one is, Moderator: A moderator is used to slow down the high energy neutrons to provide slow neutrons. Graphite and heavy water are the commonly used moderators.\nThird one is, Control rod: Control rods are used to control the number of neutrons in order to have sustained chain reaction. Mostly boron or cadmium rods are used as control rods. They absorb the neutrons.\nFourth one is, Coolant: A coolant is used to remove the heat produced in the reactor core, to produce steam. This steam is used to run a turbine in order to produce electricity. Water, air and helium are some of the coolants.\nLast one is, Protection wall: A thick concrete lead wall is built around the nuclear reactor in order to prevent the harmful radiations from escaping into the environment.\n6. 7. 3. Uses of a nuclear reactor\nNuclear reactors are widely used in ^generation.\nThey are also used to produce radio isotopes, which are used in a variety of applications.\nSome reactors help us to do research in the field of nuclear physics.\nBreeder reactors are used to convert non - fissionable materials into fissionable materials.\n6. 7. 4. Nuclear ^plants in India\nIndianAtomicEnergyCommission (AEC) was established in August 1948 by the Department of Indian Scientific Research committee at Bombay (now Mumbai) in Maharashtra. It is the nodal agency for all the research done in the field of atomic energy. Dr. Homi Jahangir Bhaba was the first chairman of Indian Atomic Energy Commission. Now, it is known as Bhaba Atomic Research Centre (BARC).\nNuclear ^is the fifth largest source of ^in India. Tarapur Atomic ^Station is India\u2019s first nuclear ^station. Now, there are a total of seven ^stations, one each in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and two in Tamil Nadu. In Tamilnadan, we have nuclear ^stations in Kalpakkam and Kudankulam. Apsara was the first nuclear reactor built in India and Asia. Now, there are 22 nuclear reactors which are operating in India.

The first nuclear reactor was built in 1942 at Chicago, USA.\n6. 7. 1 Types of nuclear reactors\nBreeder reactor, fast breeder reactor, pressurized water reactor, pressurized heavy water reactor, boiling water reactor, water - cooled reactor, gas - cooled reactor, fusion reactor and thermal reactor are some types of nuclear reactors, which are used in different places world - wide.\n6. 7. 2 Components of a nuclear reactors\nThe essential components of a nuclear reactor are (1) fuel, (2) moderator, (3) control rod, (4) coolant and (5) protection wall.\nFirst is. Fuel: A fissile material is used as the fuel. The commonly used fuel material is uranium.\nSecond one is, Moderator: A moderator is used to slow down the high energy neutrons to provide slow neutrons. Graphite and heavy water are the commonly used moderators.\nThird one is, Control rod: Control rods are used to control the number of neutrons in order to have sustained chain reaction. Mostly boron or cadmium rods are used as control rods. They absorb the neutrons.\nFourth one is, Coolant: A coolant is used to remove the heat produced in the reactor core, to produce steam. This steam is used to run a turbine in order to produce electricity. Water, air and helium are some of the coolants.\nLast one is, Protection wall: A thick concrete lead wall is built around the nuclear reactor in order to prevent the harmful radiations from escaping into the environment.\n6. 7. 3. Uses of a nuclear reactor\nNuclear reactors are widely used in ^generation.\nThey are also used to produce radio isotopes, which are used in a variety of applications.\nSome reactors help us to do research in the field of nuclear physics.\nBreeder reactors are used to convert non - fissionable materials into fissionable materials.\n6. 7. 4. Nuclear ^plants in India\nIndianAtomicEnergyCommission (AEC) was established in August 1948 by the Department of Indian Scientific Research committee at Bombay (now Mumbai) in Maharashtra.

Matter is made of atoms. Curiously the idea of atom was first proposed by the Greek philosophers in the fifth century BC (BCE). But their theory was more philosophical than scientific.\nThe first scientific theory of the atom was proposed by John Dalton.

Atoms are the building blocks of matter. Since matter has mass, it must be due to its atoms. According to the modern atomic theory, an atom contains subatomic particles such as protons, neutrons and electrons. Protons and neutrons have considerable mass, but electrons don't have such a considerable mass. Thus, the mass of an atom is mainly contributed by its protons and neutrons and hence the sum of the number of protons and neutrons of an atom is called its mass number.\nIndividual atoms are very small, and it is difficult to measure their masses.

The early pioneers of chemistry used to measure the atomic mass of an atom relative to an atom of another element. They measured the masses of equal number of atoms of two or more elements at a time, to determine their relative masses. They established one element as a standard, gave it an arbitrary value of atomic mass and using this value they measured the relative mass of other elements. The mass obtained by this way is called relative atomic mass. In the beginning, the mass of hydrogen atom was chosen as a standard and masses of other atoms were compared with it, because of the existence of isotopic character of hydrogen (1H1, 1H2, 1H3). Later hydrogen atom was replaced by oxygen atom as the standard. Now, the stable isotope of carbon (C - 12) with atomic mass 12 is used as the standard for measuring the relative atomic mass of an element.\nRelative atomic mass of an element is the ratio between the average mass of its isotopes to\n1 by 12 th part of the mass of a carbon - 12 atom. It is denoted as Ar. It is otherwise called \u201cStandard Atomic Weight\u201d.\nRelative Atomic Mass\nModern methods of determination of atomic mass by Mass Spectrometry uses C - 12 as standard. For most of the elements, the relative atomic mass is very closer to a whole number, and it is rounded off to a whole number, to make calculations easier. Table 7. 1 lists some of the elements of periodic table and their Relative Atomic mass values.\nTable 7. 1 Relative atomic mass of elements (C - 12 Scale)\nRelative atomic mass\nDo you Know\nRelative Atomic Mass is only a ratio, so it has no unit. If the atomic mass of an element is expressed in grams, it is called as Gram Atomic Mass\nGram Atomic Mass of hydrogen = 1 gram\nGram Atomic Mass of carbon = 12 gram\nGram Atomic Mass of nitrogen = 14 gram\nGram Atomic Mass of oxygen = 16 gram\n7. 0. 2Average Atomic Mass (AAM)\n7. 0. 2Average Atomic Mass (AAM)\nHow can one measure the atomic mass of an element? It is somewhat more complicated because most of the naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes, each of which has its own mass. Thus, it is essential to consider this isotopic mixture while calculating the atomic mass of an element.\nThe average atomic mass of an element is the weighted average of the masses of its naturally occurring isotopes.\nBut, the abundance of isotopes of each element may differ. So, the abundancy of all these isotopes is taken into consideration while calculating the atomic mass. Then, what do we mean by a weighted average?\nLet us consider an element which exists as a mixture of 50% of an isotope having a mass of 9 amu, and 50% of another isotope having a mass of 10 amu. Then, its average atomic mass is calculated by the following equation:\nAverage atomic mass\n= (Mass of 1st isotope \u00d7 % abundance of 1st isotope) + (Mass of 2nd isotope \u00d7 % abundance of 2nd isotope) Thus, for the given element the average\n(Note: In the calculations involving percentages, you need to convert percentage abundance into fractional abundance. For example, 50 percent is converted into 50 by 100 or 0. 50 as shown in a foresaid calculation. )\nThe atomic masses of elements, given in the periodic table, are average atomic masses. Some \u00d7 , the term atomic weight is used to mean average atomic mass. It is observed, from the periodic table that atomic masses of most of the elements are not whole numbers. For instance, the atomic mass of carbon given in the periodic table is 12. 01 amu, not 12. 00 amu. The reason is that while calculating the atomic mass of carbon, both of its natural isotopes such as carbon - 12. and carbon - 13 are considered.

The early pioneers of chemistry used to measure the atomic mass of an atom relative to an atom of another element. They measured the masses of equal number of atoms of two or more elements at a time, to determine their relative masses. They established one element as a standard, gave it an arbitrary value of atomic mass and using this value they measured the relative mass of other elements. The mass obtained by this way is called relative atomic mass. In the beginning, the mass of hydrogen atom was chosen as a standard and masses of other atoms were compared with it, because of the existence of isotopic character of hydrogen (1H1, 1H2, 1H3). Later hydrogen atom was replaced by oxygen atom as the standard. Now, the stable isotope of carbon (C - 12) with atomic mass 12 is used as the standard for measuring the relative atomic mass of an element.\nRelative atomic mass of an element is the ratio between the average mass of its isotopes to\n1 by 12 th part of the mass of a carbon - 12 atom. It is denoted as Ar. It is otherwise called \u201cStandard Atomic Weight\u201d.\nRelative Atomic Mass\nModern methods of determination of atomic mass by Mass Spectrometry uses C - 12 as standard. For most of the elements, the relative atomic mass is very closer to a whole number, and it is rounded off to a whole number, to make calculations easier. Table 7. 1 lists some of the elements of periodic table and their Relative Atomic mass values.\nTable 7. 1 Relative atomic mass of elements (C - 12 Scale)\nRelative atomic mass\nDo you Know\nRelative Atomic Mass is only a ratio, so it has no unit. If the atomic mass of an element is expressed in grams, it is called as Gram Atomic Mass\nGram Atomic Mass of hydrogen = 1 gram\nGram Atomic Mass of carbon = 12 gram\nGram Atomic Mass of nitrogen = 14 gram\nGram Atomic Mass of oxygen = 16 gram\n7. 0. 2Average Atomic Mass (AAM)\n7. 0. 2Average Atomic Mass (AAM)\nHow can one measure the atomic mass of an element? It is somewhat more complicated because most of the naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes, each of which has its own mass. Thus, it is essential to consider this isotopic mixture while calculating the atomic mass of an element.\nThe average atomic mass of an element is the weighted average of the masses of its naturally occurring isotopes.\nBut, the abundance of isotopes of each element may differ. So, the abundancy of all these isotopes is taken into consideration while calculating the atomic mass. Then, what do we mean by a weighted average?\nLet us consider an element which exists as a mixture of 50% of an isotope having a mass of 9 amu, and 50% of another isotope having a mass of 10 amu. Then, its average atomic mass is calculated by the following equation:\nAverage atomic mass\n= (Mass of 1st isotope \u00d7 % abundance of 1st isotope) + (Mass of 2nd isotope \u00d7 % abundance of 2nd isotope) Thus, for the given element the average\n(Note: In the calculations involving percentages, you need to convert percentage abundance into fractional abundance. For example, 50 percent is converted into 50 by 100 or 0. 50 as shown in a foresaid calculation. )\nThe atomic masses of elements, given in the periodic table, are average atomic masses. Some \u00d7 , the term atomic weight is used to mean average atomic mass. It is observed, from the periodic table that atomic masses of most of the elements are not whole numbers. For instance, the atomic mass of carbon given in the periodic table is 12. 01 amu, not 12. 00 amu. The reason is that while calculating the atomic mass of carbon, both of its natural isotopes such as carbon - 12. and carbon - 13 are considered. The natural abundance of C - 12 and C - 13 are 98. 90 % and 1. 10 % respectively.

If the atomic mass of an element is expressed in grams, it is called as Gram Atomic Mass\nGram Atomic Mass of hydrogen = 1 gram\nGram Atomic Mass of carbon = 12 gram\nGram Atomic Mass of nitrogen = 14 gram\nGram Atomic Mass of oxygen = 16 gram\n7. 0. 2Average Atomic Mass (AAM)\n7. 0. 2Average Atomic Mass (AAM)\nHow can one measure the atomic mass of an element? It is somewhat more complicated because most of the naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes, each of which has its own mass. Thus, it is essential to consider this isotopic mixture while calculating the atomic mass of an element.\nThe average atomic mass of an element is the weighted average of the masses of its naturally occurring isotopes.\nBut, the abundance of isotopes of each element may differ. So, the abundancy of all these isotopes is taken into consideration while calculating the atomic mass. Then, what do we mean by a weighted average?\nLet us consider an element which exists as a mixture of 50% of an isotope having a mass of 9 amu, and 50% of another isotope having a mass of 10 amu. Then, its average atomic mass is calculated by the following equation:\nAverage atomic mass\n= (Mass of 1st isotope \u00d7 % abundance of 1st isotope) + (Mass of 2nd isotope \u00d7 % abundance of 2nd isotope) Thus, for the given element the average\n(Note: In the calculations involving percentages, you need to convert percentage abundance into fractional abundance. For example, 50 percent is converted into 50 by 100 or 0. 50 as shown in a foresaid calculation. )\nThe atomic masses of elements, given in the periodic table, are average atomic masses. Some \u00d7 , the term atomic weight is used to mean average atomic mass. It is observed, from the periodic table that atomic masses of most of the elements are not whole numbers. For instance, the atomic mass of carbon given in the periodic table is 12. 01 amu, not 12. 00 amu. The reason is that while calculating the atomic mass of carbon, both of its natural isotopes such as carbon - 12. and carbon - 13 are considered. The natural abundance of C - 12 and C - 13 are 98. 90 % and 1. 10 % respectively. The average of the atomic mass of carbon is calculated as follows:\nSo, it is important to understand that if it is mentioned that the atomic mass of carbon is 12 amu, it refers to the average atomic mass of the carbon isotopes, not the mass of the individual atoms of carbon.\nTable 7. 2 Atomic mass of some elements\nAtomic Number\nAtomicMass unit(amu)\nCalculation of average atomic mass \u2013 Solved Examples\nExample 1: Oxygen is the most abundant element in both the Earth\u2019s crust and the human body. It exists as a mixture of three stable isotopes in nature as shown in Table 7. 3:\nTable 7. 3 Isotopes of oxygen\nMass (Atomic Mass Unit)\n% abundance\nThe atomic mass of\nOxygen = (15. 9949 \u00d7 0. 99757) + (16. 9991 \u00d7\n0. 00038) + (17. 9992 \u00d7 0. 00205)\n= 15. 999amu.\nExample 2: Boron naturally occurs as a mixture of boron - 10 (5 protons + 5 neutrons) and boron - 11 (5 protons + 6 neutrons) isotopes. The percentage abundance of B - 10 is 20 and that of B - 11 is 80. Then, the atomic mass of boron is calculated as follows:\nAtomic massof boron is equal to 10*20 / 100 + 11*80 / 100\n= (10 \u00d7 0. 20) + (11 \u00d7 0. 80)\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Oxygen gas exists in two allotropic forms: Oxygen (O2) and Ozone (O3). In oxygen molecule, there are two oxygen atoms. So, its atomicity is two. Since both the atoms are similar, oxygen (O2) is a homo diatomic molecule.

If a molecule contains more than three atoms, then it is calledpolyatomic molecule.\nConsider hydrogen chloride. It consists of two atoms, but of different elements, that is hydrogen and chlorine. So, its atomicity is two. It is a hetero diatomic molecule. Similarly, the water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. So, its atomicity is three. It is a hetero triatomic molecule.\nFigure 7. 2 Heteroatomic molecules\nActivity7. 2\nClassify the following molecules based on their atomicity and fill in the table:\nHydrogeniodide (H I), Sulphuric acid (H2 s o 4), Methane(CH4), Glucose(C6H12O6), Carbon monoxide(C O)\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The Relative Molecular Mass of a molecule is the ratio between the mass of one molecule of the substance to 1 by 12 th mass of an atom of Carbon 12\nDo you Know\nRelative Molecular Mass is only a ratio. So, it has no unit. If the molecular mass of a compound is expressed in grams, it is called Gram Molecular Mass.\nGram Molecular Mass of water = 18gram\nGram Molecular Mass of carbon dioxide = 44gram\nGram MolecularMass of ammonia = 17gram\nGram Molecular Mass of HCl = 36. 5gram\nThe relative molecular mass is obtained by adding together the relative atomic masses of all the atoms present in a molecule.\nCalculation of relative molecular mass \u2013 Solved examples:\nExample 1: Relative molecular mass of sulphuric acid (H2SO4) is calculated as follows: Sulphuric acid contains 2 atoms of hydrogen, 1 atom of sulphur and 4 atoms of oxygen.\nTherefore, Relative molecular mass of sulphuric acid = (2 \u00d7 mass of hydrogen) + (1 \u00d7 mass of sulphur) + (4 \u00d7 mass of oxygen)\n= (2 \u00d7 1) + (1 \u00d7 32) + (4 \u00d7 16)\nThat is one molecule of H2SO4 is 98 \u00d7 as heavy as 1 by 12 the of the mass of a carbon 12.\nExample 2: Relative molecular mass of water (H2O) is calculated as follows: A water molecule is made of 2 atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.\nSo, the relative molecular mass of water\n= (2 \u00d7 mass of hydrogen) + (1 \u00d7 mass of oxygen)\n= (2 \u00d7 1) + (1 \u00d7 16)\nThat is one molecule of H2O is 18 \u00d7 as heavy as1 by 12 thof the mass of a carbon 12.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Atomic mass units provide a relative scale for the masses of the elements. Since the atoms have such small masses, no usable scale can be devised to weigh them in the calibrated units of atomic mass units. In any real situation, we deal with macroscopic samples containing enormous number of atoms. Therefore, it is convenient to have a special unit to describe a very large number of atoms. The idea of a \u2018unit\u2019 to denote a particular number of objects is not new. For example, the pair (2 items) and the dozen (12 items), are all familiar units. Chemists measure atoms and molecules in moles. So, you can now understand that \u2018mole\u2019 denotes a number of particles.\nIn the SI system, the mole (mol) is the amount of a substance that contains as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, or other particles) as there are atoms in exactly 12 gram (or 0. 012 kg) of the carbon 12 isotope. The actual number of atoms in 12 gram of carbon 12 is determined experimentally. This is called\nAvogadro\u2019s Number (NA), named after an Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro who proposed its significance. Its value is 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23. So, one mole of a substance contains 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23 entities. Thus, 5 moles of oxygen molecules contain 5 \u00d7 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23 molecules.\nMole Concept: The study of the collection of particles by using mole as the counting unit, in order to express the mass and volume of such unit particles in a bulk of matter is known as mole concept.\nThe number of moles of a substance can be calculated by various means depending on the data available, as follows:\nNumber of moles of molecules.\nNumber of moles of atoms.\nNumber of moles of a gas (Standard molar volume at STP = 22. 4 litre).\nNumber of moles of ions.\nSTP - StandardTemperatureand Pressure (273. 15 Kelvin, 1. 00 standard atmosphere pressure)\nMole of atoms:\nOne mole of an element contains6. 023 \u00d7 10^23 atoms and it is equal to its gram atomic mass.\nThat is, one mole of oxygen contains 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23 atoms of oxygen, and its gram atomic mass is 16 gram.\nMole of molecules:\nOne mole of matter contains 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23 molecules, and it is equal to its gram molecular mass.\nThat is, onemole of oxygencontains 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23 molecules of oxygen and its gram molecular mass is 32 gram.\nMolar volume:\nOne mole of any gas occupies 22. 4 litre or 22400 ml at S.

Atomic mass units provide a relative scale for the masses of the elements. Since the atoms have such small masses, no usable scale can be devised to weigh them in the calibrated units of atomic mass units. In any real situation, we deal with macroscopic samples containing enormous number of atoms. Therefore, it is convenient to have a special unit to describe a very large number of atoms. The idea of a \u2018unit\u2019 to denote a particular number of objects is not new. For example, the pair (2 items) and the dozen (12 items), are all familiar units. Chemists measure atoms and molecules in moles. So, you can now understand that \u2018mole\u2019 denotes a number of particles.\nIn the SI system, the mole (mol) is the amount of a substance that contains as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, or other particles) as there are atoms in exactly 12 gram (or 0. 012 kg) of the carbon 12 isotope. The actual number of atoms in 12 gram of carbon 12 is determined experimentally. This is called\nAvogadro\u2019s Number (NA), named after an Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro who proposed its significance. Its value is 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23. So, one mole of a substance contains 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23 entities. Thus, 5 moles of oxygen molecules contain 5 \u00d7 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23 molecules.\nMole Concept: The study of the collection of particles by using mole as the counting unit, in order to express the mass and volume of such unit particles in a bulk of matter is known as mole concept.\nThe number of moles of a substance can be calculated by various means depending on the data available, as follows:\nNumber of moles of molecules.\nNumber of moles of atoms.\nNumber of moles of a gas (Standard molar volume at STP = 22. 4 litre).\nNumber of moles of ions.\nSTP - StandardTemperatureand Pressure (273. 15 Kelvin, 1. 00 standard atmosphere pressure)\nMole of atoms:\nOne mole of an element contains6. 023 \u00d7 10^23 atoms and it is equal to its gram atomic mass.\nThat is, one mole of oxygen contains 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23 atoms of oxygen, and its gram atomic mass is 16 gram.\nMole of molecules:\nOne mole of matter contains 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23 molecules, and it is equal to its gram molecular mass.\nThat is, onemole of oxygencontains 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23 molecules of oxygen and its gram molecular mass is 32 gram.\nMolar volume:\nOne mole of any gas occupies 22. 4 litre or 22400 ml at S.

By 1860, scientists had already discovered 60 elements and determined their atomic masses. They noticed that some elements had similar properties and hence arranged them into groups. During this period, several new elements were discovered. These elements were found to have different properties. It was realized that instead of studying the properties of all these elements individually, it would be more convenient to divide them into groups and periods in such a way that each group contained a certain number of elements (like an array of fruits and vegetables showing orderliness) with similar properties and periods showing a regular gradation.

For example, the atomic mass of argon (39. 95 amu) is greater than that of potassium (39. 10 amu), but argon comes before potassium in the periodic table. If elements were arranged solely according to increasing atomic mass, argon would appear in the position occupied by potassium in our modern periodic table (see in Figure 8. 1). No chemist would place argon, a gas with no tendency to react, in the same group as lithium and sodium, which are two highly reactive metals. This kind of discrepancies suggested that some fundamental property other than atomic mass must be the basis of periodicity. The fundamental property turned out to be the number of protons in an atom\u2019s nucleus, something that could not have been known by Mendeleev and his contemporaries.\nHenry Moseley, a British scientist in 1912, discovered a new property of elements called atomic number, which provided a better basis for the periodic arrangement of the elements. It is a well - known fact that atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons or the number of electrons present in the neutral atom of an element. The periodic law was, therefore, modified to frame a modern periodic law, which states that\n\u201cThe physical and chemical properties of the elements are the periodic functions of\ntheir atomic numbers\u201d.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 1 (e.g., 'What is...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation + analogy + unique follow-up question for concept 1.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 2 (e.g., 'Why does...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned reasoning + unique follow-up question for concept 2.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 10.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 10.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

For example, the atomic mass of argon (39. 95 amu) is greater than that of potassium (39. 10 amu), but argon comes before potassium in the periodic table. If elements were arranged solely according to increasing atomic mass, argon would appear in the position occupied by potassium in our modern periodic table (see in Figure 8. 1). No chemist would place argon, a gas with no tendency to react, in the same group as lithium and sodium, which are two highly reactive metals. This kind of discrepancies suggested that some fundamental property other than atomic mass must be the basis of periodicity. The fundamental property turned out to be the number of protons in an atom\u2019s nucleus, something that could not have been known by Mendeleev and his contemporaries.\nHenry Moseley, a British scientist in 1912, discovered a new property of elements called atomic number, which provided a better basis for the periodic arrangement of the elements.

The modern periodic table is a tabular arrangement of elements in rows and columns, highlighting the regular repetition of properties of the elements. Figure 8. 1 shows the modern periodic table of 118 elements discovered so far.\nAs you have studied the features of the modern periodic table in standard IX, here let us confine to the study of the features of periods and groups.\nFeatures of Periods\nThe horizontal rows are called periods. There are seven periods in the periodic table.\nFirst period (Atomic number 1 and 2): This is the shortest period. It contains only two elements (Hydrogen and Helium).\nSecond period (Atomic number 3 to 10): This is a short period. It contains eight elements (Lithium to Neon).\nThird period (Atomic number 11 to 18): This is also a short period. It contains eight elements (Sodium to Argon).\nFourth period (Atomic number 19 to 36): This is a long period. It contains eighteen elements (Potassium to Krypton). This includes 8 representative elements and 10 transition elements.\nFifth period (Atomic number 37 to 54): This is also a long period. It contains 18 elements (Rubidium to Xenon). This includes 8 representative elements and 10 transition elements.\nSixth period (Atomic number 55 to 86): This is the longest period. It contains 32 elements (Caesium to Radon). This includes 8 representative elements, 10 transition elements and 14 inner transition elements (Lanthanides).\nSeventh period (Atomic number 87 to 118): Like the sixth period, this period also accommodates 32 elements. Recently 4 elements have been included by IUPAC.\nFeatures of Groups\nThe vertical columns in the periodic table starting from top to bottom are called groups.

For example, all the elements of group 1 have one electron in their valence shells (1s1). So, the valency of all the alkali metals is \u20181\u2019.\nAs the elements present in a group have identical valence shell electronic configurations, they possess similar chemical properties.\nThe physical properties of the elements in a group such as melting point, boiling point and density vary gradually.\nThe atoms of the 'group 18' elements have stable electronic configuration in their valence shells and hence they are unreactive.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 1 (e.g., 'What is...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation + analogy + unique follow-up question for concept 1.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 2 (e.g., 'Why does...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned reasoning + unique follow-up question for concept 2.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 10.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 10.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The modern periodic table is a tabular arrangement of elements in rows and columns, highlighting the regular repetition of properties of the elements. Figure 8. 1 shows the modern periodic table of 118 elements discovered so far.\nAs you have studied the features of the modern periodic table in standard IX, here let us confine to the study of the features of periods and groups.\nFeatures of Periods\nThe horizontal rows are called periods. There are seven periods in the periodic table.\nFirst period (Atomic number 1 and 2): This is the shortest period. It contains only two elements (Hydrogen and Helium).\nSecond period (Atomic number 3 to 10): This is a short period. It contains eight elements (Lithium to Neon).\nThird period (Atomic number 11 to 18): This is also a short period. It contains eight elements (Sodium to Argon).\nFourth period (Atomic number 19 to 36): This is a long period. It contains eighteen elements (Potassium to Krypton). This includes 8 representative elements and 10 transition elements.\nFifth period (Atomic number 37 to 54): This is also a long period. It contains 18 elements (Rubidium to Xenon). This includes 8 representative elements and 10 transition elements.\nSixth period (Atomic number 55 to 86): This is the longest period. It contains 32 elements (Caesium to Radon). This includes 8 representative elements, 10 transition elements and 14 inner transition elements (Lanthanides).\nSeventh period (Atomic number 87 to 118): Like the sixth period, this period also accommodates 32 elements. Recently 4 elements have been included by IUPAC.\nFeatures of Groups\nThe vertical columns in the periodic table starting from top to bottom are called groups.

So, the valency of all the alkali metals is \u20181\u2019.\nAs the elements present in a group have identical valence shell electronic configurations, they possess similar chemical properties.\nThe physical properties of the elements in a group such as melting point, boiling point and density vary gradually.\nThe atoms of the 'group 18' elements have stable electronic configuration in their valence shells and hence they are unreactive.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Anything which repeats itself after a regular interval is called periodic and this behaviour is called periodicity. Some of the atomic properties of the elements are periodic.\nProperties such as atomic radius, ionic radius, ionisation energy, electronegativity, electron affinity, show a regular periodicity and hence they are called periodic properties. The main significance of the modern periodic table is that it gives a clear understanding of the general properties and trends within a group or a period to predict with considerable accuracy, the properties of any element, even though that element may be unfamiliar to us. Let us discuss the periodic trend of some of the properties.\n8. 3. 1 Atomic Radius\nAtomic radius of an atom is defined as the distance between the centre of its nucleus and the outermost shell containing the valence electron. Direct measurement of the radius of an isolated atom is not possible. Except for noble gases, usually the atomic radius is referred to as covalent radius or metallic radius depending on the nature of the\n(a)Metallic Radius\n(b)Covalent Radius\nbonding between the concerned atoms. Atomic radius in metal atoms is known as metallic radius. It is defined as half the distance between the nuclei of adjacent metal atoms (Figure 8. 2a)).\nIn non - metallic elements, their atomic radius is known as Covalent radius. It is defined as half the distance between the nuclei of two covalently bonded atoms of the same element in a molecule (Figure 8. 2 (b)). For example, let us consider H2 molecule. The distance between the two hydrogen nuclei of the molecule is 0. 74 Angstrom. So its covalent radius is 0. 74 by 2 = 0. 37 Angstrom.\nWhen you look at the variation of the atomic radii in the periodic table, there are two distinct trends. Along the period, from left to right, the atomic radius of the elements decreases whereas along the groups, from the top to bottom, the atomic radius increases.\nFigure 8. 3 Atomic radius\nThe increase, down a group, is due to the increase in the valence shell number down the group. As the shell number increases, the distance between the valence shell and the nucleus increases. In contrast, when you observe along the period, the shell number remains the same but the number of protons (i. e. atomic number) increases. More and more positive charges impose a strong attraction over the electrons and thus the electron cloud shrinks towards the nucleus, which results in the decrease in the atomic size. Figure 8. 4 shows how the atomic radius decreases from lithium to boron.\nFigure 8. 4 Variation of atomic radius\n8. 3. 2 Ionic Radii\nIt is defined as the distance from the centre of the nucleus of the ion up to the point where it exerts its influence on the electron cloud of the ion.\nFigure 8. 5 Relative ionic radii of cation and anion\nYou know that ions are formed when an atom loss or gain electrons. When a neutral atom loses an electron, it becomes a positively charged ion called cation, whereas the gain of an electron by a neutral atom forms a negatively charged ion called anion. The size of the ions is important to determine their behaviours in Solutions and the structure of ionic solids. The size of a cation is always smaller than its corresponding neutral atom. But the anion is larger than its neutral atom.\nFor instance, lithium and sodium lose the single electron from their outermost energy level to form cations. The ions so formed are smaller because the remaining electrons are at inner cells and attracted more strongly by the nucleus. Fluorine and chlorine become negative ions by gaining an electron. When electrons are added, the charge on the nucleus is not great enough to hold the increased number of electrons as closely as it holds the electrons in the neutral atom. So, as seen in atomic radius, ionic radii also decrease along the period from left to right and increase down the group.\n8. 3. 3 Ionisation Energy\nIonisation energy is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from an isolated gaseous atom in its ground state to form a cation. It is otherwise called ionisation enthalpy. It is measured in kJ per mol. Higher the ionisation energy; it is more difficult to remove the electron.\nAs the atomic size decreases from left to right in a period, more energy is required to remove the electrons. So, the ionisation energy increases along the period. But, down the group, the atomic size increases and hence the valence electrons are loosely bound. They require relatively less energy for the removal. Thus, ionisation energy decreases down the group in the periodic table.\nNote: As the positive charge increases the size of the cation decreases as the negative charge increases the size of the anion increases\n8. 3. 4 Electron Affinity\nElectron affinity is the amount of energy released when an isolated gaseous atom gains an electron to form its anion. It is also measured in kJ per mol and represented by the following equation:\nA(g) + electron gives A(g) negative ion + Energy\nCl(g) + electron gives C l negative ion gaseous state + energy\nLike ionisation energy, electron affinity also increases from left to right in a period and decreases from top to bottom in a group.\nMore to Know\nNoble gases show no tendency to accept electrons because the outer s and p orbitals of noble gases are completely filled. No more electrons can be added to them and hence their electron affinities are zero.\n8. 3. 5 Electronegativity\nElectronegativity of an element is the measure of the tendency of its atom to attract the shared pair of electrons towards itself in a covalent bond. Let us consider HCl molecule. Both the hydrogen and chlorine atoms share one electron each to form the covalent bond between them. chlorine atom has a higher electronegativity and hence it pulls the shared electrons towards itself more strongly than hydrogen. Thus, when the bond breaks, the bonding electrons are left with chlorine forming Hpositive ion and C l negative ions. It is represented, diagrammatically, as shown below:\nFigure 8. 6 Relative electronegativity of H and Cl\nElectronegativity is based on various experimental data such as bond energy, ionization potential, electron affinity, etc. Pauling scale is the widely used scale to determine the electronegativity, which in turn predicts the nature of bonding (ionic or covalent) between the atoms in a molecule. Electronegativity of some of the elements are given below\nF = 4. 0, Cl = 3. 0, Br = 2. 8, I = 2. 5, H = 2. 1, Na = 1\nIf the difference in electronegativity between two elements is 1. 7, the bond has 50% ionic character and 50% covalent character.\nIf the difference is less than 1. 7, the bond is considered to be covalent.\nIf the difference is greater than 1. 7, the bond is considered to be more ionic.\nAlong the period, from left to right in the periodic table, the electronegativity increases because of the increase in the nuclear charge which in turn attracts the electrons more strongly. On moving down a group, the electronegativity of the elements decreases because of the increased number of valence shells.\nPeriodicProperty\nAtomic radius\nIonic radius\nIonisation energy\nElectron affinity\nElectro negativity\nTest yourself\nPredict the nature of the bond in the following molecules.\n1) NaCl (ii) NaBr (iii) NaI (iv) NaF (5) NaH\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 1 (e.g., 'What is...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation + analogy + unique follow-up question for concept 1.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 2 (e.g., 'Why does...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned reasoning + unique follow-up question for concept 2.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 10.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 10.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Figure 8. 4 shows how the atomic radius decreases from lithium to boron.\nFigure 8. 4 Variation of atomic radius\n8. 3. 2 Ionic Radii\nIt is defined as the distance from the centre of the nucleus of the ion up to the point where it exerts its influence on the electron cloud of the ion.\nFigure 8. 5 Relative ionic radii of cation and anion\nYou know that ions are formed when an atom loss or gain electrons. When a neutral atom loses an electron, it becomes a positively charged ion called cation, whereas the gain of an electron by a neutral atom forms a negatively charged ion called anion. The size of the ions is important to determine their behaviours in Solutions and the structure of ionic solids. The size of a cation is always smaller than its corresponding neutral atom. But the anion is larger than its neutral atom.\nFor instance, lithium and sodium lose the single electron from their outermost energy level to form cations. The ions so formed are smaller because the remaining electrons are at inner cells and attracted more strongly by the nucleus. Fluorine and chlorine become negative ions by gaining an electron. When electrons are added, the charge on the nucleus is not great enough to hold the increased number of electrons as closely as it holds the electrons in the neutral atom. So, as seen in atomic radius, ionic radii also decrease along the period from left to right and increase down the group.\n8. 3. 3 Ionisation Energy\nIonisation energy is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from an isolated gaseous atom in its ground state to form a cation.

Thus, when the bond breaks, the bonding electrons are left with chlorine forming Hpositive ion and C l negative ions. It is represented, diagrammatically, as shown below:\nFigure 8. 6 Relative electronegativity of H and Cl\nElectronegativity is based on various experimental data such as bond energy, ionization potential, electron affinity, etc. Pauling scale is the widely used scale to determine the electronegativity, which in turn predicts the nature of bonding (ionic or covalent) between the atoms in a molecule. Electronegativity of some of the elements are given below\nF = 4. 0, Cl = 3. 0, Br = 2. 8, I = 2. 5, H = 2. 1, Na = 1\nIf the difference in electronegativity between two elements is 1. 7, the bond has 50% ionic character and 50% covalent character.\nIf the difference is less than 1. 7, the bond is considered to be covalent.\nIf the difference is greater than 1. 7, the bond is considered to be more ionic.\nAlong the period, from left to right in the periodic table, the electronegativity increases because of the increase in the nuclear charge which in turn attracts the electrons more strongly. On moving down a group, the electronegativity of the elements decreases because of the increased number of valence shells.\nPeriodicProperty\nAtomic radius\nIonic radius\nIonisation energy\nElectron affinity\nElectro negativity\nTest yourself\nPredict the nature of the bond in the following molecules.\n1) NaCl (ii) NaBr (iii) NaI (iv) NaF (5) NaH\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 1 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 1, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 1.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 2 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 2, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 2.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 3 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 3, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 4 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 4, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 5 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 5, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 6 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 6, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 7 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 7, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 8 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 8, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 9 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 9, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 10 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 10, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 10.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Anything which repeats itself after a regular interval is called periodic and this behaviour is called periodicity. Some of the atomic properties of the elements are periodic.\nProperties such as atomic radius, ionic radius, ionisation energy, electronegativity, electron affinity, show a regular periodicity and hence they are called periodic properties. The main significance of the modern periodic table is that it gives a clear understanding of the general properties and trends within a group or a period to predict with considerable accuracy, the properties of any element, even though that element may be unfamiliar to us. Let us discuss the periodic trend of some of the properties.\n8. 3. 1 Atomic Radius\nAtomic radius of an atom is defined as the distance between the centre of its nucleus and the outermost shell containing the valence electron. Direct measurement of the radius of an isolated atom is not possible. Except for noble gases, usually the atomic radius is referred to as covalent radius or metallic radius depending on the nature of the\n(a)Metallic Radius\n(b)Covalent Radius\nbonding between the concerned atoms. Atomic radius in metal atoms is known as metallic radius. It is defined as half the distance between the nuclei of adjacent metal atoms (Figure 8. 2a)).\nIn non - metallic elements, their atomic radius is known as Covalent radius. It is defined as half the distance between the nuclei of two covalently bonded atoms of the same element in a molecule (Figure 8. 2 (b)). For example, let us consider H2 molecule. The distance between the two hydrogen nuclei of the molecule is 0. 74 Angstrom. So its covalent radius is 0. 74 by 2 = 0. 37 Angstrom.\nWhen you look at the variation of the atomic radii in the periodic table, there are two distinct trends. Along the period, from left to right, the atomic radius of the elements decreases whereas along the groups, from the top to bottom, the atomic radius increases.\nFigure 8. 3 Atomic radius\nThe increase, down a group, is due to the increase in the valence shell number down the group. As the shell number increases, the distance between the valence shell and the nucleus increases. In contrast, when you observe along the period, the shell number remains the same but the number of protons (i. e. atomic number) increases. More and more positive charges impose a strong attraction over the electrons and thus the electron cloud shrinks towards the nucleus, which results in the decrease in the atomic size. Figure 8. 4 shows how the atomic radius decreases from lithium to boron.\nFigure 8. 4 Variation of atomic radius\n8. 3. 2 Ionic Radii\nIt is defined as the distance from the centre of the nucleus of the ion up to the point where it exerts its influence on the electron cloud of the ion.\nFigure 8. 5 Relative ionic radii of cation and anion\nYou know that ions are formed when an atom loss or gain electrons.

The main significance of the modern periodic table is that it gives a clear understanding of the general properties and trends within a group or a period to predict with considerable accuracy, the properties of any element, even though that element may be unfamiliar to us. Let us discuss the periodic trend of some of the properties.\n8. 3. 1 Atomic Radius\nAtomic radius of an atom is defined as the distance between the centre of its nucleus and the outermost shell containing the valence electron. Direct measurement of the radius of an isolated atom is not possible. Except for noble gases, usually the atomic radius is referred to as covalent radius or metallic radius depending on the nature of the\n(a)Metallic Radius\n(b)Covalent Radius\nbonding between the concerned atoms. Atomic radius in metal atoms is known as metallic radius. It is defined as half the distance between the nuclei of adjacent metal atoms (Figure 8. 2a)).\nIn non - metallic elements, their atomic radius is known as Covalent radius. It is defined as half the distance between the nuclei of two covalently bonded atoms of the same element in a molecule (Figure 8. 2 (b)). For example, let us consider H2 molecule. The distance between the two hydrogen nuclei of the molecule is 0. 74 Angstrom. So its covalent radius is 0. 74 by 2 = 0. 37 Angstrom.\nWhen you look at the variation of the atomic radii in the periodic table, there are two distinct trends. Along the period, from left to right, the atomic radius of the elements decreases whereas along the groups, from the top to bottom, the atomic radius increases.\nFigure 8. 3 Atomic radius\nThe increase, down a group, is due to the increase in the valence shell number down the group. As the shell number increases, the distance between the valence shell and the nucleus increases. In contrast, when you observe along the period, the shell number remains the same but the number of protons (i. e. atomic number) increases. More and more positive charges impose a strong attraction over the electrons and thus the electron cloud shrinks towards the nucleus, which results in the decrease in the atomic size. Figure 8. 4 shows how the atomic radius decreases from lithium to boron.\nFigure 8. 4 Variation of atomic radius\n8. 3. 2 Ionic Radii\nIt is defined as the distance from the centre of the nucleus of the ion up to the point where it exerts its influence on the electron cloud of the ion.\nFigure 8. 5 Relative ionic radii of cation and anion\nYou know that ions are formed when an atom loss or gain electrons. When a neutral atom loses an electron, it becomes a positively charged ion called cation, whereas the gain of an electron by a neutral atom forms a negatively charged ion called anion. The size of the ions is important to determine their behaviours in Solutions and the structure of ionic solids. The size of a cation is always smaller than its corresponding neutral atom. But the anion is larger than its neutral atom.\nFor instance, lithium and sodium lose the single electron from their outermost energy level to form cations. The ions so formed are smaller because the remaining electrons are at inner cells and attracted more strongly by the nucleus. Fluorine and chlorine become negative ions by gaining an electron. When electrons are added, the charge on the nucleus is not great enough to hold the increased number of electrons as closely as it holds the electrons in the neutral atom. So, as seen in atomic radius, ionic radii also decrease along the period from left to right and increase down the group.\n8. 3. 3 Ionisation Energy\nIonisation energy is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from an isolated gaseous atom in its ground state to form a cation.

Let us consider HCl molecule. Both the hydrogen and chlorine atoms share one electron each to form the covalent bond between them. chlorine atom has a higher electronegativity and hence it pulls the shared electrons towards itself more strongly than hydrogen.

On moving down a group, the electronegativity of the elements decreases because of the increased number of valence shells.\nPeriodicProperty\nAtomic radius\nIonic radius\nIonisation energy\nElectron affinity\nElectro negativity\nTest yourself\nPredict the nature of the bond in the following molecules.\n1) NaCl (ii) NaBr (iii) NaI (iv) NaF (5) NaH\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Hence, bauxite is an ore of aluminium and clay is its mineral.\nMining: The process of extracting the ores from the Earth's crust is called mining.\nGangue or Matrix: The rocky impurity associated with an ore is called gangue or matrix.\nFlux: It is the substance added to the ore to reduce the fusion temperature and to remove the impurities. E. g. , Calcium oxide (basic), Silica (acidic). If the gangue is acidic, then basic flux is added and vice versa.\nSlag: It is the fusible product formed when a flux reacts with a gangue during the extraction of metals.\nFlux + Gangue gives Slag\nSmelting: Smelting is the process of reducing the roasted metallic oxide from the metal in its molten condition. In this process, impurities are removed as slag by the addition of flux.\n8. 4. 2 Types of separation or concentration of an ore\nThere are four major types of separation of ores based on the nature of the ore. The different kinds of ores of metals are given in Table 8. 1\nConcentration of the crushed ore is done mainly by the following methods: -\n(i)Hydraulic (Gravity Separation) method\nPrinciple: The difference in the densities or specific gravities of the ore and the gangue is the main principle behind this method. Oxide ores are purified by this method. example Haematite F e2 O3 the ore of iron.\nNote: When the ore is heavier than the impurity, this method can be used.\nMethod: The ore is poured over a sloping, vibrating corrugated table with grooves and a jet of water is allowed to flow over it. The denser ore particles settle down in the grooves and lighter gangue particles are washed down by water.\n(ii) Magnetic separation method\nPrinciple: The magnetic properties of the ores form the basis of separation. When either the ore or the gangue is magnetic, this method is employed. e. g. , Tinstone S n O2, the ore of tin.\nFigure 8. 8 Magnetic separation\nMethod: The crushed ore is placed over a conveyer belt which rotates around two metal wheels, one of which is magnetic. The magnetic particles are attracted to the magnetic wheel and fall separately apart from the non - magnetic particles.\n(iii)Froth floatation\nPrinciple: This process depends on the preferential wettability of the ore with oil (pine oil) and the gangue particles by water. Lighter ores, such as sulphide ores, are concentrated by this method.\ne. g. , Zinc blende (Z n S).\nFigure 8. 9 Froth floatation\nNote: When the impurity is heavier than the ore this method can be used.\nMethod: The crushed ore is taken in a large tank containing pine oil and water and agitated with a current of compressed air. The ore is wetted by the oil and gets separated from the gangue in the form of froth. Since the ore is lighter, it comes on the surface with the froth and the impurities are left behind. e. g. , Zinc blende (ZnS).\n(iv) Chemical method or Leaching\nTable 8. 1 Types of ores\nCarbonate Ores\nHalide Ores\nSulphide Ores\nBauxite (A l2 O3. 2H2 O)\nMarble(Ca CO3)\nCryolite(Na3 A l F6)\nGalena(P b S)\nCuprite(Cu2 O)\nMannesite ((MgCO3)\nFluorspar(Ca F2)\nIron pyrite(Fe S2)\nHaematite (Fe2O3)\nSiderite (Fe CO3)\nRocksalt(NaCl)\nZinc blende(Z n S)\nMore to Know\nExtraction of metal from metal oxide can be categorized into three types\nMore reactive metals\nMedium reactive metals\nLess reactive metals\nNa, K, Ca, Mg, A l\nZ n, F e, Pb, Cu\nElectrolytic reduction of\nMetal oxide into metal\nChemical reduction of metal\nOxide into metal using coke\nThermal decomposition of\nMetal oxide into metal\nThis method is employed when the ore is in a very pure form.\nThe ore is treated with a suitable reagent such that the ore is soluble in it but the impurities are not. The impurities are removed by filtration. The Solution of the ore, ie. , the filtrate is treated with a suitable reagent which precipitates the ore. E. g. Bauxite Al2O3. 2H2O, the ore of aluminium.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 1 (e.g., 'What is...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation + analogy + unique follow-up question for concept 1.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 2 (e.g., 'Why does...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned reasoning + unique follow-up question for concept 2.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 10.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 10.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Hence, bauxite is an ore of aluminium and clay is its mineral.\nMining: The process of extracting the ores from the Earth's crust is called mining.\nGangue or Matrix: The rocky impurity associated with an ore is called gangue or matrix.\nFlux: It is the substance added to the ore to reduce the fusion temperature and to remove the impurities. E. g. , Calcium oxide (basic), Silica (acidic). If the gangue is acidic, then basic flux is added and vice versa.\nSlag: It is the fusible product formed when a flux reacts with a gangue during the extraction of metals.\nFlux + Gangue gives Slag\nSmelting: Smelting is the process of reducing the roasted metallic oxide from the metal in its molten condition. In this process, impurities are removed as slag by the addition of flux.\n8. 4. 2 Types of separation or concentration of an ore\nThere are four major types of separation of ores based on the nature of the ore. The different kinds of ores of metals are given in Table 8. 1\nConcentration of the crushed ore is done mainly by the following methods: -\n(i)Hydraulic (Gravity Separation) method\nPrinciple: The difference in the densities or specific gravities of the ore and the gangue is the main principle behind this method. Oxide ores are purified by this method. example Haematite F e2 O3 the ore of iron.\nNote: When the ore is heavier than the impurity, this method can be used.\nMethod: The ore is poured over a sloping, vibrating corrugated table with grooves and a jet of water is allowed to flow over it. The denser ore particles settle down in the grooves and lighter gangue particles are washed down by water.\n(ii) Magnetic separation method\nPrinciple: The magnetic properties of the ores form the basis of separation. When either the ore or the gangue is magnetic, this method is employed. e. g. , Tinstone S n O2, the ore of tin.\nFigure 8. 8 Magnetic separation\nMethod: The crushed ore is placed over a conveyer belt which rotates around two metal wheels, one of which is magnetic. The magnetic particles are attracted to the magnetic wheel and fall separately apart from the non - magnetic particles.\n(iii)Froth floatation\nPrinciple: This process depends on the preferential wettability of the ore with oil (pine oil) and the gangue particles by water. Lighter ores, such as sulphide ores, are concentrated by this method.\ne. g. , Zinc blende (Z n S).\nFigure 8. 9 Froth floatation\nNote: When the impurity is heavier than the ore this method can be used.\nMethod: The crushed ore is taken in a large tank containing pine oil and water and agitated with a current of compressed air. The ore is wetted by the oil and gets separated from the gangue in the form of froth. Since the ore is lighter, it comes on the surface with the froth and the impurities are left behind. e. g. , Zinc blende (ZnS).\n(iv) Chemical method or Leaching\nTable 8. 1 Types of ores\nCarbonate Ores\nHalide Ores\nSulphide Ores\nBauxite (A l2 O3. 2H2 O)\nMarble(Ca CO3)\nCryolite(Na3 A l F6)\nGalena(P b S)\nCuprite(Cu2 O)\nMannesite ((MgCO3)\nFluorspar(Ca F2)\nIron pyrite(Fe S2)\nHaematite (Fe2O3)\nSiderite (Fe CO3)\nRocksalt(NaCl)\nZinc blende(Z n S)\nMore to Know\nExtraction of metal from metal oxide can be categorized into three types\nMore reactive metals\nMedium reactive metals\nLess reactive metals\nNa, K, Ca, Mg, A l\nZ n, F e, Pb, Cu\nElectrolytic reduction of\nMetal oxide into metal\nChemical reduction of metal\nOxide into metal using coke\nThermal decomposition of\nMetal oxide into metal\nThis method is employed when the ore is in a very pure form.\nThe ore is treated with a suitable reagent such that the ore is soluble in it but the impurities are not. The impurities are removed by filtration. The Solution of the ore, ie. , the filtrate is treated with a suitable reagent which precipitates the ore. E. g. Bauxite Al2O3. 2H2O, the ore of aluminium.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Copper is found in the native state as well as combined state.\nOres of copper\nCopperpyrites\nCuprite or ruby copper\nCopper glance\nThe chief ore of copper is copper pyrite. It yields nearly 76% of the world production of copper. Extraction of copper from copper pyrites involves the following steps\ni. Concentration of ore: The ore is crushed and concentrated by froth floatation process.\nii. Roasting: The concentrated ore is roasted in excess of air. During the process of roasting, the moisture and volatile impurities are removed. Sulphur, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony are removed as oxides. Copper pyrite is partly converted into sulphides of copper and iron.\n2 CuF e S 2 + O2 gives Cu2S + 2 F e S + S O2 gas.\niii. Smelting: The roasted ore is mixed with powdered coke and sand and is heated in a blast furnace to obtain matte (Cu2 S + F e S) and slag. The slag is removed as waste.\niv. Bessemerisation: The molten matte is transferred to Bessemer converter in order to obtain blister copper. Ferrous sulphide from matte is oxidized to ferrous oxide, which is removed as slag using silica.\n2 F e S + 3 O2 gives 2 F e O + 2 S O2 gas\nF e O + S i O2 gives F e S I O 3 (slag) (Iron silicate)\n2 Cu2 S + 3O2 gives 2 Cu2 O + 2 S O2 gas\n2 Cu2 O + Cu2 S gives 6 Cu + S O2 gas (Blister copper)\nv. Refining: Blister copper contains 98% of pure copper and 2% of impurities and is purified by electrolytic refining. This method is used to get metal of a high degree of purity. For electrolytic refining of copper, we use:\nCathode: A thin plate of pure copper metal.\nAnode: A block of impure copper metal.\nElectrolyte: Copper sulphate Solution acidified with sulphuric acid.\nWhen electric current is passed through the electrolytic Solution, pure copper gets deposited at the cathode and the impurities settle at the bottom of the anode in the form of sludge called anode mud.\nPhysical Properties of Copper\nCopper is a reddish - brown metal, with high lustre, high density and high melting point (1356\u00b0C).\nChemical Properties of Copper\n1. Action of Air and Moisture: Copper gets covered with a green layer of basic copper carbonate in the presence of C O2 and moisture.\n2Cu + O2 + C O2 + H2O gives Cu C O3. Cu (O H)twice.\n2. Action of Heat: On heating at different temperatures in the presence of oxygen, copper forms two types of oxides Cu O, Cu2 O\n2 Cu + O2when heated below 1370 kelvin it gives2 CuO Copper II oxide (black)\n4 Cu + O2 when heated above 1370 kelvin it gives 2Cu2 O Copper one oxide (red)\n3. Action of Acids:\na) With dilute HCl and dilute H2 S O4:\nDilute acids such as HCl and H2 S O4 have no action on these metals in the absence of air. Copper dissolves in these acids in the presence of air.\n2Cu + 4HCl + O2(air) gives 2CuCl2 + 2H2O\nb) With dil. HNO3:\nCopper reacts with dil. HNO3 with the liberation of Nitric Oxide gas\n3Cu + 8HNO3 givesCu (N O3)twice + 2N O gas + 4H2O\n4. Action of Chlorine:\nChlorine reacts with copper, resulting in theformation of copper (II) chloride.\nCu + Cl2 gives Cu Cl2\n5.

It yields nearly 76% of the world production of copper. Extraction of copper from copper pyrites involves the following steps\ni. Concentration of ore: The ore is crushed and concentrated by froth floatation process.\nii. Roasting: The concentrated ore is roasted in excess of air. During the process of roasting, the moisture and volatile impurities are removed. Sulphur, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony are removed as oxides. Copper pyrite is partly converted into sulphides of copper and iron.\n2 CuF e S 2 + O2 gives Cu2S + 2 F e S + S O2 gas.\niii. Smelting: The roasted ore is mixed with powdered coke and sand and is heated in a blast furnace to obtain matte (Cu2 S + F e S) and slag. The slag is removed as waste.\niv. Bessemerisation: The molten matte is transferred to Bessemer converter in order to obtain blister copper. Ferrous sulphide from matte is oxidized to ferrous oxide, which is removed as slag using silica.\n2 F e S + 3 O2 gives 2 F e O + 2 S O2 gas\nF e O + S i O2 gives F e S I O 3 (slag) (Iron silicate)\n2 Cu2 S + 3O2 gives 2 Cu2 O + 2 S O2 gas\n2 Cu2 O + Cu2 S gives 6 Cu + S O2 gas (Blister copper)\nv. Refining: Blister copper contains 98% of pure copper and 2% of impurities and is purified by electrolytic refining. This method is used to get metal of a high degree of purity. For electrolytic refining of copper, we use:\nCathode: A thin plate of pure copper metal.\nAnode: A block of impure copper metal.\nElectrolyte: Copper sulphate Solution acidified with sulphuric acid.\nWhen electric current is passed through the electrolytic Solution, pure copper gets deposited at the cathode and the impurities settle at the bottom of the anode in the form of sludge called anode mud.\nPhysical Properties of Copper\nCopper is a reddish - brown metal, with high lustre, high density and high melting point (1356\u00b0C).\nChemical Properties of Copper\n1. Action of Air and Moisture: Copper gets covered with a green layer of basic copper carbonate in the presence of C O2 and moisture.\n2Cu + O2 + C O2 + H2O gives Cu C O3. Cu (O H)twice.\n2. Action of Heat: On heating at different temperatures in the presence of oxygen, copper forms two types of oxides Cu O, Cu2 O\n2 Cu + O2when heated below 1370 kelvin it gives2 CuO Copper II oxide (black)\n4 Cu + O2 when heated above 1370 kelvin it gives 2Cu2 O Copper one oxide (red)\n3.

It occurs in nature as oxides, sulphides and carbonates. The ores of iron are as follows:\nOres of iron\nIron pyrite\nIron is chiefly extracted from haematite ore (F e2O3)\n1. Concentration by Gravity Separation: The powdered ore is washed with a steam of water. As a result, the lighter sand particles and other impurities are washed away and the heavier ore particles settle down.\n2. Roasting and Calcination: The concentrated ore is strongly heated in a limited supply of air in a reverberatory furnace. As a result, moisture is driven out and sulphur, arsenic and phosphorus impurities are oxidized off.\n3. Smelting (in a Blast Furnace): The charge consisting of roasted ore, coke and limestone in the ratio 8: 4: 1 is smelted in a blast furnace by introducing it through the hopper arrangement at the top. There are three important regions in the furnace.\nFigure 8. 11 Blast Furnace\n(a)The Lower Region (Combustion Zone) - The temperature is at 1500\u00b0C. In this region, coke burns with oxygen to form C O2 when the charge comes in contact with a hot blast of air.\nC + O2when heated at 1500 degree Celsius it gives C O2 + Heat\nIt is an exothermic reaction since heat is liberated.\n(b) The Middle Region (Fusion Zone) \u2013 The temperature prevails at 1000\u00b0C. In this region, C O2 is reduced to C O.\nCO2 + C when heated at 1000 degree Celsius it gives2 CO - HEAT\nLimestone decomposes to calcium oxide and C O2.\nC a C O3when heated at 1000 degree Celsius it gives C a O + C O2 - HEAT\nThese two reactions are endothermic due to absorption of heat. Calcium oxide combines with silica to form calcium silicate slag.\nC a O + S I O2 gives C a S I O3\n(c) The Upper Region (Reduction Zone) - The temperature prevails at 400\u00b0C In this region carbon monoxide reduces ferric oxide to form a fairly pure spongy iron.\nF e2 O3 + 3C O when heated at 400 degree Celsius it gives 2F e + 3C O2 gas\nThe molten iron is collected at the bottom of the furnace after removing the slag.\nThe iron thus formed is called pig iron. It is remelted and cast into different moulds. This iron is called cast iron.\nPhysical properties:\n1. It is a lustrous metal, greyish white in colour.\nii. It has high tensility, malleability and ductility.\niii. It can be magnetized.\nChemical properties:\n1. Reaction with air or oxygen: Only onheating in air, iron formsmagnetic oxide.\n3 F e + 2 O2 gives F e 3 O4 BLACK\nii. Reaction with moist air: When iron is exposed to moist air, it forms a layer of brown hydrated ferric oxide on its surface. This compound is known as rust and the phenomenon of formation of rust is known as rusting.\n4 F e + 3 O2 + x H2 O gives 2 F e 2 O3. x H2 O (rust)\niii. Reaction with steam: When steam is passed over red - hot iron, magnetic oxide is formed.\n3 F e + 4 H2 O (STEAM) gives F e 3 O4 + 4 H2 gas\niv. Reaction with chlorine: Iron combines with chlorine to form ferric chloride.\n2 F e + 3 C l 2 gives 2 F e C l3(ferricchloride)\n5.

It occurs in nature as oxides, sulphides and carbonates. The ores of iron are as follows:\nOres of iron\nIron pyrite\nIron is chiefly extracted from haematite ore (F e2O3)\n1. Concentration by Gravity Separation: The powdered ore is washed with a steam of water. As a result, the lighter sand particles and other impurities are washed away and the heavier ore particles settle down.\n2. Roasting and Calcination: The concentrated ore is strongly heated in a limited supply of air in a reverberatory furnace. As a result, moisture is driven out and sulphur, arsenic and phosphorus impurities are oxidized off.\n3. Smelting (in a Blast Furnace): The charge consisting of roasted ore, coke and limestone in the ratio 8: 4: 1 is smelted in a blast furnace by introducing it through the hopper arrangement at the top. There are three important regions in the furnace.\nFigure 8. 11 Blast Furnace\n(a)The Lower Region (Combustion Zone) - The temperature is at 1500\u00b0C. In this region, coke burns with oxygen to form C O2 when the charge comes in contact with a hot blast of air.\nC + O2when heated at 1500 degree Celsius it gives C O2 + Heat\nIt is an exothermic reaction since heat is liberated.\n(b) The Middle Region (Fusion Zone) \u2013 The temperature prevails at 1000\u00b0C. In this region, C O2 is reduced to C O.\nCO2 + C when heated at 1000 degree Celsius it gives2 CO - HEAT\nLimestone decomposes to calcium oxide and C O2.\nC a C O3when heated at 1000 degree Celsius it gives C a O + C O2 - HEAT\nThese two reactions are endothermic due to absorption of heat. Calcium oxide combines with silica to form calcium silicate slag.\nC a O + S I O2 gives C a S I O3\n(c) The Upper Region (Reduction Zone) - The temperature prevails at 400\u00b0C In this region carbon monoxide reduces ferric oxide to form a fairly pure spongy iron.\nF e2 O3 + 3C O when heated at 400 degree Celsius it gives 2F e + 3C O2 gas\nThe molten iron is collected at the bottom of the furnace after removing the slag.\nThe iron thus formed is called pig iron. It is remelted and cast into different moulds. This iron is called cast iron.\nPhysical properties:\n1. It is a lustrous metal, greyish white in colour.\nii. It has high tensility, malleability and ductility.\niii. It can be magnetized.\nChemical properties:\n1. Reaction with air or oxygen: Only onheating in air, iron formsmagnetic oxide.\n3 F e + 2 O2 gives F e 3 O4 BLACK\nii. Reaction with moist air: When iron is exposed to moist air, it forms a layer of brown hydrated ferric oxide on its surface. This compound is known as rust and the phenomenon of formation of rust is known as rusting.\n4 F e + 3 O2 + x H2 O gives 2 F e 2 O3. x H2 O (rust)\niii. Reaction with steam: When steam is passed over red - hot iron, magnetic oxide is formed.\n3 F e + 4 H2 O (STEAM) gives F e 3 O4 + 4 H2 gas\niv. Reaction with chlorine: Iron combines with chlorine to form ferric chloride.\n2 F e + 3 C l 2 gives 2 F e C l3(ferricchloride)\n5. Reaction with acids: With dilute HCl and dilute H2 S O4 it liberates H2 gas.\nF e + 2 HCl gives F e Cl2 + H2 gas\nF e + H2 S O4 gives F e S O4 + H2 gas\nWith dilute HNO3 in cold condition it gives ferrous nitrate and ammonium nitrate.\n4F e + 10HNO3 gives4F e (N O3) twice + NH4N O3 + 3 H2O\nWith con. H2 S O4 it forms ferric sulphate and liberates S O2.\n2F e + 6H2S O4 givesFe2(S O4) thrice + 3S O2 + 6H2O\nWhen iron is dipped in concentrated H N O3 it becomes chemically passive or inert due to the formation of a layer of iron oxide (F e 3 O4) on its surface.\nUses of iron\nPig iron(Iron with 2 - 4. 5% of carbon): It is used in making pipes, stoves, radiators, railings, manhole covers and drain pipes.\nSteel(Iron with less than 0. 25% of carbon): It is used in the construction of buildings, machinery, transmission cables and T.

Alloying: The metals can be alloyed to prevent the process of corrosion. E. g. : Stainless Steel\nii. Surface Coating: It involves application of a protective coating over the metal. It is of the following types:\na) Galvanization: It is the process of coating zinc on iron sheets by using electric current.\nb) Electroplating: It is a method of coating one metal over another metal by passing electric current.\nc) Anodizing: It is an electrochemical process that converts the metal surface into a decorative, durable and corrosion resistant. Aluminium is widely used for anodizing process.\nd) Cathodic Protection: It is the method of controlling corrosion of a metal surface protected is coated with the metal which is easily corrodible. The easily corrodible metal is called Sacrificial metal to act as anode ensuring cathodic protection.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Most of the substances that we encounter in our daily life are mixtures of two or more substances. The substances present in a mixture may exist in one or more physical state. For example, when we burn wood, the smoke released is a mixture of solid carbon and gases like C O2, C O, etc.\nIn some cases of mixtures, their components can be separated easily whereas in some other cases they cannot be. Consider the two mixtures, one which contains salt and water, and the another which contains sand and water. Water is the one of the components in both the mixtures. In the first case salt dissolves in water. In the second case the sand does not dissolve in water. Sand in water can be separated by filtration but salt cannot be separated as it dissolves in water to form a homogeneous mixture.

In a Solution, the component which is present in lesser amount (by weight), is called solute and the component, which is present in a larger amount (by weight) is called solvent. The solute gets distributed uniformly throughout the solvent and thus forming the mixture homogeneous. So, the solvent acts as a dissolving medium in a Solution. The process of uniform distribution of solute into solvent is called disSolution. Figure 9. 2 shows the schematic representation of Solution.\nA Solution must at least be consisting of two components (a solute and a solvent). Such Solutions which are made of one solute and one solvent (two components) are called binary Solutions. e. g. On adding copper sulphate crystals to water, it dissolves in water forming a Solution of copper sulphate as shown in Figure 9. 3.

In a Solution, the component which is present in lesser amount (by weight), is called solute and the component, which is present in a larger amount (by weight) is called solvent. The solute gets distributed uniformly throughout the solvent and thus forming the mixture homogeneous. So, the solvent acts as a dissolving medium in a Solution. The process of uniform distribution of solute into solvent is called disSolution. Figure 9. 2 shows the schematic representation of Solution.\nA Solution must at least be consisting of two components (a solute and a solvent). Such Solutions which are made of one solute and one solvent (two components) are called binary Solutions. e. g. On adding copper sulphate crystals to water, it dissolves in water forming a Solution of copper sulphate as shown in Figure 9. 3. It contains two components i. e. one solute - copper sulphate and one solvent - water So it is a binary Solution. Similarly, a Solution may contain more than two components. For example if salt and sugar are added to water, both dissolve in water forming a Solution. Here two solutes are dissolved in one solvent.

Example 40 gram of sodium chloride in 100 gram of water at 25 degree Celcius forms super saturated Solution. This state can be achieved by altering any other conditions like temperature, pressure.

The solubility is mathematically expressed as\nSolubility = mass of the solute multiplied by 100 / mass of the solvent.\nTable 9. 2 Solubility\u2019s of some common substances in water at 25 degree Celcius\nName ofthesolute\nFormula of the solute\nSolubility gram per 100 gram water\nCalcium carbonate\nC a C O3 (solid)\nSodium chloride\nNaCl(solid)\nSodium hydroxide\nNaOH(solid)\nC6H12O6(solid)\nSodium bromide\nNaBr (solid)\nSodium iodide\nNa I (solid)\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 1 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 1, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 1.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 2 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 2, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 2.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 3 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 3, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 4 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 4, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 5 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 5, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 6 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 6, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 7 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 7, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 8 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 8, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 9 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 9, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Misconception 10 based on the topic text.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging opener 10, followed by a gentle, syllabus-aligned correction for Misconception 10.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

They are:\n(i) Nature of the solute and solvent\n(ii) Temperature\n(iii) Pressure\n(i) Nature of the solute and solvent\nThe nature of the solute and solvent plays an important role in solubility. Although water dissolves an enormous variety of substances, both ionic and covalent, it does not dissolve everything. The phrase that scientists often use when predicting solubility is \u201clike dissolves like. \u201d This expression means that dissolving occurs when similarities exist between the solvent and the solute. For example: Common salt is a polar compound and dissolves readily in polar solvent like water. Non - polar compounds are soluble in non - polar solvents. For example, Fat dissolved in ether. But non - polar compounds, do not dissolve in polar solvents; polar compounds do not dissolve in non - polar solvents.\nii. Effect of Temperature\nSolubility of Solids in Liquid: Generally, solubility of a solid solute in a liquid solvent increase with increase in temperature. For example, a greater amount of sugar will dissolve in warm water than in cold water. In endothermic process, solubility increases with increase in temperature. In exothermic process, solubility decreases with increase in temperature.\nSolubility of Gases in liquid Do you know why is it bubbling when water is boiled? Solubility of gases in liquid decrease with increase in temperature. Generally, water contains dissolved oxygen. When water is boiled, the solubility of oxygen in water decreases, so oxygen escapes in the form of bubbles. Aquatic animals live more in cold regions because, more amount of dissolved oxygen is present in the water of cold regions. This shows that the solubility of oxygen in water is more at low temperatures.\nEffect of Pressure\nEffect of pressure is observed only in the case of solubility of a gas in a liquid. When the pressure is increased, the solubility of a gas in liquid increases. The common examples for solubility of gases in liquids are carbonated beverages, That is soft drinks, household cleaners containing aqueous Solution of ammonia, formalin - aqueous Solution of formaldehyde, etc. .\nFigure9. 6 Effect of pressure on solubility\nMore to know\nThe effect of pressure on the solubility of a gas in liquid is given by Henry\u2019s law. It states that, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas over the Solution at a definite temperature.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 1 (e.g., 'What is...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation + analogy + unique follow-up question for concept 1.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 2 (e.g., 'Why does...?').>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned reasoning + unique follow-up question for concept 2.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 3.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 4.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 5.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 6.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 7.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 8.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 9.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A simple student question about key concept 10.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Syllabus-aligned explanation for concept 10.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

They are:\n(i) Nature of the solute and solvent\n(ii) Temperature\n(iii) Pressure\n(i) Nature of the solute and solvent\nThe nature of the solute and solvent plays an important role in solubility. Although water dissolves an enormous variety of substances, both ionic and covalent, it does not dissolve everything. The phrase that scientists often use when predicting solubility is \u201clike dissolves like. \u201d This expression means that dissolving occurs when similarities exist between the solvent and the solute. For example: Common salt is a polar compound and dissolves readily in polar solvent like water. Non - polar compounds are soluble in non - polar solvents. For example, Fat dissolved in ether. But non - polar compounds, do not dissolve in polar solvents; polar compounds do not dissolve in non - polar solvents.\nii. Effect of Temperature\nSolubility of Solids in Liquid: Generally, solubility of a solid solute in a liquid solvent increase with increase in temperature. For example, a greater amount of sugar will dissolve in warm water than in cold water. In endothermic process, solubility increases with increase in temperature. In exothermic process, solubility decreases with increase in temperature.\nSolubility of Gases in liquid Do you know why is it bubbling when water is boiled? Solubility of gases in liquid decrease with increase in temperature. Generally, water contains dissolved oxygen. When water is boiled, the solubility of oxygen in water decreases, so oxygen escapes in the form of bubbles. Aquatic animals live more in cold regions because, more amount of dissolved oxygen is present in the water of cold regions. This shows that the solubility of oxygen in water is more at low temperatures.\nEffect of Pressure\nEffect of pressure is observed only in the case of solubility of a gas in a liquid. When the pressure is increased, the solubility of a gas in liquid increases. The common examples for solubility of gases in liquids are carbonated beverages, That is soft drinks, household cleaners containing aqueous Solution of ammonia, formalin - aqueous Solution of formaldehyde, etc. .\nFigure9. 6 Effect of pressure on solubility\nMore to know\nThe effect of pressure on the solubility of a gas in liquid is given by Henry\u2019s law.

This process is called hydration. These ionic substances crystallize out from their saturated aqueous Solution with a definite number of molecules of water. The numberof water molecules found in the crystalline substance is called water of crystallization. Such salts are called hydrated salts.\nOn heating these hydrated crystalline salts, they lose their water of crystallization and become amorphous or lose their colour(if they are coloured). Table 9. 3 shows some common hydrated salts:\nTable 9. 3 Hydrated salts\nCommon Name\nMolecular Formula\nBlueVitriol\nCopper(II) sulphate pentahydrate\nMagnesium sulphate heptahydrate\nCalciumsulphate dihydrate\nC a S O4. 2H2O\nGreenVitriol\nIron (II) sulphate heptahydrate\nF eS O4. 7H2 O\nWhiteVitriol\nZincsulphate heptahydrate\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 1, using one of the specified tones>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 1, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 2, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 2, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 3, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 3, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 4, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 4, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 5, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 5, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 6, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 6, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 7, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 7, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 8, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 8, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 9, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 9, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Natural student opener 10, using a different tone>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Engaging starter 10, naming the specific subject and referencing a unique detail from the text, with a unique next step.>\"\n  }\n]\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}
