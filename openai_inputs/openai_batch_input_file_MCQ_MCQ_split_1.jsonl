He stated that a moving body naturally comes to rest without any external influence of the force. Such motions are termed as \u2018natural motion\u2019 (Force independent). He also proposed that a force (a push or a pull) is needed to make the bodies to move from their natural state (rest) and behave contrary to their own natural state called as \u2018violent motion\u2019 (Force dependent). Further, he said, when two different mass bodies are dropped from a height, the heavier body falls faster than the lighter one.\nGalileo proposed the following concepts about force, motion and inertia of bodies:\nThe natural state of all earthly bodies is either the state of rest or the state of uniform motion.\nA body in motion will continue to be in the same state of motion as long as no external force is applied.\nWhen a force is applied on bodies, they resist any change in their state. This property of bodies is called \u2018inertia\u2019.\nWhen dropped from a height in vacuum, bodies of different size, shape and mass fall at the same rate and reach the ground at the same time.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Similarly, when the vehicle suddenly is moved forward from rest, you lean backward. This is due to, anybody would like to continue to be in its state of rest or the state of motion.

Now, keep a coin at the center of the cardboard. Then, flick the cardboard quickly. What do you observe?\nThe cardboard falls off the ground and the coin falls into the glass tumbler.\nIn activity described above, the inertia of the coin keeps it in the state of rest when the cardboard moves. Then, when the cardboard has moved, the coin falls into the tumbler due to gravity. This happens due to \u2018inertia of rest\u2019.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

To quantify the impact of a force exactly, a new physical quantity known as linear momentum is defined. The linear momentum measures the impact of a force on a body.\nThe product of mass and velocity of a moving body gives the magnitude of linear momentum.

It is equal to the vector sum (adding the magnitude of the forces with their direction) of all the forces.\nTable 1. 1 action of forcres\nAction of forces\nResultant force (F net)\nParallel forces are acting in the same direction\nF net = F 1 + F 2\nParallel unequal forces are acting in opposite direction\nF net = F1 - F2 ( if F 1 is greater than F 2)\nF net = F2 - F1 ( if F 2 is greater than F 1)\nF net is directed along the greater force.\nParallel equal forces are acting in opposite directions in the same line of action ( F 1 = F 2)\nF net = F1 - F2 (F 1 = F2)\nFigure 1. 2 Combined effect of forces\n(a)Unlike parallel forces \u2013 Tug of war\n(a)Unlike parallel forces \u2013 Tug of war\n(b) Unbalanced forces \u2013 Action of a lever\n(c) Like parallel forces\nIf the resultant force of all the forces acting on a body is equal to zero, then the body will be in equilibrium. Such forces are called balanced forces. If the resultant force is not equal to zero, then it causes the motion of the body due to unbalanced forces\nExamples: Drawing water from a well, force applied with a crowbar, forces on a weight balance, etc. .\nA system can be brought to equilibrium by applying another force, which is equal to the resultant force in magnitude, but opposite in direction. Such force is called as \u2018Equilibrant\u2019.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

It is always placed at the edge of door and not at some other place. Why? Have you tried to push a door by placing your hand closer to the hinges or the fixed edge? What do you observe?\nThe door can be easily opened or closed when you apply the force at a point far away from the fixed edge. In this case, the effect of the force you apply is to turn the door about the fixed edge.

It is measured by the product of the force (F) and the perpendicular distance (d) between the fixed point or the fixed axis and the line of action of the force.\n\u03c4 = F \u00d7 d (1. 2)\nTorque is a vector quantity. It is acting along the direction, perpendicular to the plane containing the line of action of force and the distance. Its SI unit is N\u22c5m.\nCouple: Two equal and unlike parallel forces applied simultaneously at two distinct points constitute a couple. The line of action of the two forces does not coincide. It does not produce any translatory motion since the resultant is zero. But a couple results in causes the rotation of the body. Rotating effect of a couple is known as moment of a couple.\nExamples: Turning a tap, winding or unwinding a screw, spinning of a top, etc. .\nMoment of a couple is measured by the product of any one of the forces and the perpendicular distance between the line of action of two forces. The turning effect of a couple is measured by the magnitude of its moment.\nMoment of a couple = Force \u00d7 perpendicular distance between the line of action of forces\nM = F \u00d7 S (1. 3)\nThe unit of moment of a couple is N\u22c5m (N m) in SI system and dyne\u22c5cm in CGS system.\nBy convention, the direction of moment of a force or couple is taken as positive if the body is rotated in the anti - clockwise direction and negative if it is rotate in the clockwise direction. They are shown in\nFigures 1. 4 (a and b)\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Since there is a difference in the weight of the persons sitting on it, the heavier person lifts the lighter person. When the heavier person comes closer to the pivot point (fulcrum) the distance of the line of action of the force decreases. It causes less amount of torque to act on it.

So, it is also called as \u2018law of force\u2019. Let, \u2018m\u2019 be the mass of a moving body, moving along a straight line with an initial speed \u2018u\u2019 After a time interval of \u2018t\u2019, the velocity of the body changes to \u2018v\u2019 due to the impact of an unbalanced external force F.\nInitial momentum of the body P initial = m u\nFinal momentum of the body P final = m v\nChange in momentum \u0394p = P final - P initial\n= m v - m u\nBy Newton\u2019s second law of motion,\nForce, F is proportional to rate of change of momentum\nHere, k is the proportionality constant. (1. 5)\nSince, acceleration = change in velocity / time,\nHence, we have\nF = m \u00d7 a(1. 6)\nForce = mass \u00d7 acceleration\nNo external force is required to maintain the motion of a body moving with uniform velocity. When the net force acting on a body is not equal to zero, then definitely the velocity of the body will change. Thus, change in momentum takes place in the direction of the force. The change may take place either in magnitude or in direction or in both.\nForce is required to produce the acceleration of a body. In a uniform circular motion, even though the speed (magnitude of velocity) remains constant, the direction of the velocity changes at every point on the circular path. So, the acceleration is produced along the radius called as centripetal acceleration. The force, which produces this acceleration is called as centripetal force, about which you have learnt in class IX.\nUnits of force: SI unit of force is newton (N) and in C. G.

Rockets are filled with a fuel (either liquid or solid) in the propellant tank. When the rocket is fired, this fuel is burnt and a hot gas is ejected with a high speed from the nozzle of the rocket, producing a huge momentum. To balance this momentum, an equal and opposite reaction force is produced in the combustion chamber, which makes the rocket project forward.\nWhile in motion, the mass of the rocket gradually decreases, until the fuel is completely burnt out. Since, there is no net external force acting on it, the linear momentum of the system is conserved. The mass of the rocket decreases with altitude, which results in the gradual increase in velocity of the rocket. At one stage, it reaches a velocity, which is sufficient to just escape from the gravitational pull of the Earth. This velocity is called escape velocity.

This change in velocity must be due to the force acting on the object. The acceleration of the body is due to the Earth\u2019s gravitational force. So, it is called as \u2018acceleration due to the gravitational force of the Earth\u2019 or \u2018acceleration due to gravity of the Earth\u2019. It is represented as \u2018g\u2019. Its unit is m s ^ - 2.\nMean value of the acceleration due to gravity is taken as 9. 8 m s ^ - 2 on the surface of the Earth. This means that the velocity of a body during the downward free fall motion varies by\n9. 8 m s ^ - 1 for every 1 second. However, the value of \u2018g\u2019 is not the same at all points on the surface of the earth.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Let us compute the magnitude of this force in two ways. Let, M be the mass of the Earth and m be the mass of the body. The entire mass of the Earth is assumed to be concentrated at its centre. The radius of the Earth is R = 6378 km ( = 6400 km approximately). By Newton\u2019s law of gravitation, the force acting on the body is given byF = GMm / R ^2equation 1. 11\nHere, the radius of the body considered is negligible when compared with the Earth\u2019s radius. Now, the same force can be obtained from Newton\u2019s second law of motion. According to this law, the force acting on the body is given by the product of its mass and acceleration (called as weight). Here, acceleration of the body is under the action of gravity hence a = g\nF = m a = m g\nF = weight = m gequation(1. 12)\nComparing equations (1. 7) and (1. 8), we get\nmg = GMm / R ^two equation 1. 13\nAcceleration due to gravity\ng = GMm / R ^two equation 1. 14\n1. 10. 4 Mass of the Earth (M)\nRearranging the equation (1. 14), the mass of the Earth is obtained as follows:\nMass of the Earth M = g R ^2 by G\nSubstituting the known values of g, R and G, you can calculate the mass of the Earth as\nM = 5. 972 \u00d7 10 ^24 kg\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Since, the geometric radius of the Earth is maximum in the equatorial region and minimum in the polar region, the value of g is maximum in the polar region and minimum at the equatorial region.\nWhen you move to a higher altitude from the surface of the Earth, the value of g reduces. In the same way, when you move deep below the surface of the Earth, the value of g reduces. (This topic will be discussed in detail in the higher classes). Value of g is zero at the centre of the Earth.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Mass of a body is defined as the quantity of matter contained in the body. Its SI unit is kilogram (kg).\nWeight: Weight of a body is defined as the gravitational force exerted on it due to the Earth\u2019s gravity alone.\nWeight = Gravitational Force\n= mass (m) \u00d7 acceleration due to gravity (g).\ng = acceleration due to gravity for Earth (at sea level) = 9. 8 m s ^ - 2.\nWeight is a vector quantity. Direction of weight is always towards the centre of the Earth. SI unit of weight is newton (N). Weight of a body varies from one place to another place on the Earth since it depends on the acceleration due to gravity of the Earth (g) weight of a body is more at the poles than at the equatorial region.\nThe value of acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the moon is 1. 625 m s ^ - - 2. This is about 0. 1654 \u00d7 the acceleration due to gravity of the Earth. If a person whose mass is 60 kg stands on the surface of Earth, his weight would be 588 N (W = mg = 60 \u00d7 9. 8). If the same person goes to the surface of the Moon, he would weigh only 97. 5 N\n(W = 60 \u00d7 1. 625). But his mass remains the same (60 kg) on both the Earth and the Moon.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

During the fast downward and upward movement, how did you feel?\nFigure 1. 11 Weightlessness in a roller coaster\nIt\u2019s amazing. You actually feel as if you are falling freely without having any weight. This is due to the phenomenon of \u2018weightlessness\u2019. You seem to have lost your weight when you move down with a certain acceleration. Some \u00d7 , you experience the same feeling while travelling in a lift.\nWhen the person in a lift moves down with an acceleration (a) equal to the acceleration due to gravity (g), that is, when a = g, this motion is called as \u2018free fall\u2019. Here, the apparent weight\n(R = m (g \u2013 g) = 0) (R equal to m) g - g \u2014 of the person is zero. This condition or state refers to the state of weightlessness. (Refer case 4 from Table 1. 2).\nThe same effect takes place while falling freely in a roller coaster or on a swing or in a vertical giant wheel. You feel an apparent weight loss and weight gain when you are moving up and down in such rides.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

This change may happen spontaneously or it may be facilitated by external forces or energy. Chemistry is all about chemical reactions. In your day - to - day life, you could observe many chemical reactions. A clear understanding of these reactions is essential in order to manipulate them for the sake of human life and environment. So, chemistry mainly focuses on chemical reactions. Let us try to find the answer for the following questions:\nYou need energy to play, walk, run or to perform various physical activities. Where do you get the energy from?\nHow do plants grow and get their food?\nHow does a car move use fuel?\nWhy does iron rust on its exposure to water or air?\nYou get energy from the digestion of the food you eat. Plants grow by absorbing nutrients from the Earth and get their food by photosynthesis. The combustion of a fuel makes the car to move. Oxidation of iron causes rusting. So, all these processes are chemical changes. the materials, which undergo changes are converted into some other new materials. For example, by burning petrol, the hydrocarbons present in it are converted into carbon dioxide and water. In this chapter, let us discuss the nature and types of chemical reactions.\nWhat happens during a chemical reaction?\nIn a chemical reaction, the atoms of the reacting molecules or elements are rearranged to form new molecules.\nOld chemical bonds between atoms are broken and new chemical bonds are formed.\nBond breaking absorbs energy whereas bond formation releases energy.\nHow are chemical reactions represented?\nWhen methane reacts with oxygen, it forms carbon dioxide and water. How can you represent this reaction? It can be written as a word equation as shown below:\nMethane + Oxygen \u2192 Carbon dioxide + Water\nBut this equation does not give the chemical composition of the reactants and products. So, to learn the characteristics of a chemical reaction, it is represented by a chemical equation. In the chemical equation, the chemicals of the reaction are represented by their chemical formulae. The compounds or elements, which undergo reactions (reactants) are shown to the left of an arrow and the compounds formed (products) are shown to the right of the arrow. The arrow indicates the direction of the reaction. Thus, the aforesaid reaction can be written as follows:\nC H4 + O2 gives C O2 + H2O\nBut this is also an incomplete chemical equation. Because, the law of conservation of matter states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. You cannot create new atoms by a chemical reaction. In contrast, they are rearranged in different ways by a chemical reaction to form a new compound. So, in a chemical equation, the number of atoms of the reactants and that of the products must be equal. The number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the reactants and the products are not equal in the given equation. On balancing the number of atoms, the following equation can be obtained:\nCH4 + 2O2givesC O2 + 2H2O\nFurther, the chemical equation provides information on the physical state of the substances and the conditions under which the reaction takes place.\nCH4(gas) + 2O2(gas) givesCO2(gas) + 2H2O(gas)\nMethane + Oxygen gives Carbon - dioxide + Water\nA balanced chemical equation is the simplified representation of a chemical reaction which describes the Chemical composition, physical state of the reactants and the products, and the reaction conditions.\nMORE TO KNOW\nThe phases or the physical state of the substances in a chemical reaction are denoted in short form within a bracket, as the subscript of the formula, of the respective substances. For example, when solid potassium reacts with liquid water, it produces hydrogen gas and potassium hydroxide Solution. All these information of the reaction is given in the chemical equation as shown below:\n2K(solid) + 2H2O (Liquid) gives 2KOH (aqueous) + H2(gas)\nPhase or physical state\nAqueous Solution\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

A large number of chemical reactions are taking place around us every day. Are they taking place in a similar way? No. Each reaction involves different kinds of atoms and hence the way they react also differs. Thus, based on the manner by which the atoms of the reactants are rearranged, chemical reactions are classified as follows.\na. Combination reactions\nA combination reaction is a reaction in which two or more reactants combine to form a compound. It is otherwise called 'synthesis reaction' or 'composition reaction'. When a reactant \u2018A\u2019 combines with \u2018B\u2019, it forms the product \u2018AB\u2019. The generalised scheme of a combination reaction is given below:\nExample: Hydrogen gas combines with chlorine gas to form hydrogen chloride gas.\nH2(gas) + Cl2(gas)gives 2HCl(gas)\nDepending on the chemical nature of the reactants, there are three classes of combination reactions:\nElement + Element gives Compound\nIn this type of combination reaction, two elements react with one other to form a compound. The reaction may take place between a metal and a non - metal or two non - metals.\nExample 1: When solid sulphur reacts with oxygen, it produces sulphur dioxide. Here both the reactants are non - metals.\nS(solid) + O2(gas)givesS O2(gas)\nExample 2: Sodium, a silvery - white metal, combines with chlorine, a pale - yellow green gas, to form sodium chloride, an edible compound. Here one of the reactants is a metal (sodium) and the other (chlorine) is a non - metal.\n2Na(solid) + Cl2(gas)gives 2NaCl(solid)\nTest Yourself:\nIdentify the possible combination reactions between the metals and non - metals given in the following table and write their balanced chemical equations:\nNa, K, Cs, Ca, Mg\nF, Cl, Br, I\nCompound + Element gives Compound\nIn this case, a compound reacts with an element to form a new compound. For instance, phosphorous trichloride reacts with chlorine gas and forms phosphorous pentachloride.\nP Cl3(Iiquid) + Cl2(gas)gives P Cl5(solid)\nCompound + Compound gives Compound\nIt is a reaction between two compounds to form a new compound. In the following reaction, silicon dioxide reacts with calcium oxide to form calcium silicate.\nSi O2(solid) + Ca O(solid) gives C a S i O3(solid)\nMost of the combination reactions are exothermic in nature. Because, they involve the formation of new bonds, which releases a huge amount of energy in the form of heat.\n(b) Decomposition reactions\nIn a decomposition reaction, a single compound splits into two or more simpler substances under suitable conditions. It is the opposite of the combination reaction. The generalised scheme of a decomposition reaction is given below:\nBreaking of bonds is the major phenomenon in a decomposition reaction and hence it requires energy to break the bonds, depending on the nature of the energy used in the decomposition reaction.\nThere are three main classes of decomposition reactions. They are\nThermal Decomposition Reactions\nElectrolytic Decomposition Reactions\nPhoto Decomposition Reactions\nDo You Know?\nA Solution of slaked lime is used for white washing walls. Calcium hydroxide reacts slowly with the carbon di oxide in air to form a thin layer of calcium carbonate on the walls. Calcium carbonate is formed after two to three days of white washing and gives a shiny finish to the walls. It is interesting to note that the chemical formula for marble is also CaCO3.\nCa (O H)twice(aqueous) + C O2(gas) gives C a C O3(solid) + H2O(Iiquid)\n1. Thermal Decomposition Reactions\nIn this type of reaction, the reactant is decomposed by applying heat. For example, on heating mercury (II) oxide is decomposed into mercury metal and oxygen gas. As the molecule is dissociated by the absorption of heat, it is otherwise called \u2018Thermolysis\u2019. It is a class of compound to element by element decomposition. i. e. a compound (Hg O) is decomposed into two elements (Hg and Oxygen).\n2Hg O(solid) when heated gives 2Hg(liquid) + O2(gas)\nSimilarly, when calcium carbonate is heated, it breaks down in to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. It is a type of compound to compound / compound decomposition.\nC a C O3(solid)when heated gives Ca O + C O2(gas)\nIn thermal decomposition reaction, heat is supplied to break the bonds. Such reactions, in which heat is absorbed, are called \u2018Endothermic reactions.\n(ii)Electrolytic Decomposition Reactions\nIn some of the decomposition reactions, electrical energy is used to bring about the reaction. For example, decomposition of sodium chloride occurs on passing electric current through its aqueous Solution. Sodium chloride decomposes in to metallic sodium and chlorine gas. This process is termed as \u2018Electrolysis\u2019.\n2NaCI (aqueous)undergoes electrolytic decomposition gives 2Na(solid) + CI2(gas)\nHere, a compound (NaCl) is converted into elements (sodium and chlorine). So it is a type of compound to element by element decomposition.\n(iii)Photo Decomposition Reactions\nLight is another form of energy, which facilitates some of the decomposition reactions. For example, when silver bromide is exposed to light, it breaks down into silver metal and bromine gas. As the decomposition is caused by light, this kind of reaction is also called \u2018Photolysis\u2019.\n2AgBr(solid)undergoes photo decomposition and gives 2Ag(solid) + Br2(gas)\nFigure 10. 1 Photo decomposition of silver bromide\nThe yellow - coloured silver bromide turns into grey coloured silver metal. It is also a compound to element / element decomposition.\n(a)Single Displacement Reactions\n(a)Single Displacement Reactions\nIt is a reaction between an element and a compound. When they react, one of the elements of the compound - reactant is replaced by the element - reactant to form a new compound and an element. The general schematic representation of a single displacement reaction is given as:\n\u2018A\u2019 displaces element \u2018B\u2019 from the compound \u2018B C\u2019 and hence a single displacement reaction occurs. If zinc metal is placed in hydrochloric acid, hydrogen gas is evolved. Here, hydrogen is displaced by zinc metal and zinc chloride is formed.\nZ n(Solid) + 2HCl(aqueous) gives Z n Cl2(aqueous) + H2(gas)\nF e(Solid) + Cu S O4(aqueous) \u2192 F e S O4(aqueous) + Cu(Solid)\nIf an iron nail is placed in an aqueous Solution of copper (II) sulphate as shown in Fig. 10. 2, the iron displaces copper from its aqueous Solution and the so formed copper deposits over the iron nail.\nFigure 10. 2 Displacement of copper\nIt is easy to propose so many reactions of this kind with different combinations of reactants. Will they all occur in practice? No. This is most easily demonstrated with halogens. Let us consider the following two reactions: 2NaCl(aqueous) + F2(gas) gives2Na F(aqueous) + Cl2(gas)\n2Na F(aqueous) + Cl2(gas)gives2Na Cl(aqueous) + F2(gas)\nThe first reaction involves the displacement of chlorine from NaCl, by fluorine. In the second reaction, chlorine displaces fluorine from NaF. Out of these two, the second reaction will not occur. Because, fluorine is more active than chlorine and occupies the upper position in the periodic table. So, in displacement reactions, the activity of the elements and their relative position in the periodic table are the key factors to determine the feasibility of the reactions. More active elements readily displace fewer active elements from their aqueous Solution. The activity series of some elements is given below:\n\u2022Please\u2022Send\u2022Lions\u2022Cats\u2022Monkeys\u2022And\u2022Zebras\u2022Into\u2022Lovely\u2022Hot\u2022Countries\u2022Signed\u2022General\nPotassium (K)\nLithium(Li)\nCalcium(Ca)\nMagnesium(Mg)\nAluminium(Al)\nHydrogen(H) non - metal\nSilver (Ag)\nPlatinum (Pt)\nMost reactive to least reactive\nBy referring the activity series, try to answer the following questions:\nWhich of the metals displaces hydrogen gas from hydrochloric acid? Silver or Zinc.

The ion of one compound is replaced by the ion of another compound. Ions of identical charges are only interchanged, i. e. , a cation can be replaced by other cations. This reaction is also called \u2018Metathesis Reaction\u2019. The schematic representation of a double displacement reaction is given below.\nFor a double displacement reaction to take place, one of the products must be a precipitate or water. By this way, there are major classes of double displacement reactions. They are:\n(1)Precipitation Reactions\n(ii)Neutralization Reactions\n(1) Precipitation Reactions\nWhen aqueous Solutions of two compounds are mixed, if they react to form an insoluble compound and a soluble compound, then it is called precipitation reaction. Because the insoluble compound, formed as one of the products, is a precipitate and hence the reaction is so called.\nTable 10. 1 Differences between combination and decomposition reactions\nCOMBINATION\nDECOMPOSITIONREACTIONS\nOne or more reactants combine to form a single product\nA single reactant is decomposed to form one or more products\nEnergyis released\nEnergy is absorbed\nElements or compounds may be the reactants\nSinglecompound is the reactant\nWhen the clear aqueous Solutions of potassium iodide and lead(II)nitrate are mixed, a double displacement reaction takes place between them.\nPb (N O3)twice(aqueous) + 2K I(aqueous)givesPb I2(solid precipitate) + 2K N O3(aqueous)\nPotassium and lead displace or replace one other and form a yellow precipitate of\nlead (II) iodide as shown in Fig. 10. 3.\nFigure 10. 3 Precipitation of PbI2\nActivity 10. 2\nTake a pinch of silver nitrate crystals.\nCollect about 5 ml of tap water in a test tube.\nAdd the silver nitrate crystals to water and shake well.\nObserve what happens in the test tube.\nReport your observations and what you infer from that?\n(ii) Neutralization Reactions\nIn your lower classes, you have learnt the reaction between an acid and a base. It is another type of displacement reaction in which the acid reacts with the base to form a salt and water. It is called 'neutralization reaction' as both acid and base neutralize each other.\nReaction of sodium hydroxide with hydrochloric acid is a typical neutralization reaction. Here, sodium replaces hydrogen from hydrochloric acid forming sodium chloride, a neutral soluble salt.\nNaOH(aqueous) + HCl(aqueous) givesNaCl(aqueous) + H2O(liquid)\nSimilarly, when ammonium hydroxide reacts with nitric acid, it forms ammonium nitrate and water.\nNH4O H(aqueous) + H N O3(aqueous) gives NH4N O3(aqueous) + H2O (liquid)\n(d. )Combustion Reactions\nA combustion reaction is one in which the reactant rapidly combines with oxygen to form one or more oxides and energy (heat). So in combustion reactions, one of the reactants must be oxygen. Combustion reactions are majorly used as heat energy sources in many of our day - to - day activities. For instance, we use LPG gas for domestic cooking purposes. We get heat and flame from LPG gas by its combustion reaction of its constituent gases. LPG is a mixture of hydrocarbon gases like propane, butane, propylene, etc. All these hydrocarbons burn with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water.\nC3H8(gas) + 5O2(gas) gives3C O2(gas) + 4H2O(gas) + Heat\nSince heat is evolved, it is an exothermic reaction. As oxygen is added, it is also an oxidation. So, combustion may be called as an exothermic oxidation. If a flame is formed (as shown in Figure 10. 4), then it is called burning.\nFigure 10. 4 Combustion of LPG gas\nWhich of the following is a combustion?\n(i) Digestion of Food\n(ii) Rusting of iron\nMany thousands of reactions fall under these five categories and further you will learn in detail about these reactions in your higher classes.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Are all they permanent? For example, liquid water freezes into ice, but then ice melts into liquid water. In other words, freezing is reversed. So, it is not a permanent change. Moreover, it is a physical change. Physical changes can be reversed easily. Can chemical changes be reversed? Can the products be converted into reactants? Let us consider the burning of a wood. The carbon compounds present in the wood are burnt into carbon dioxide gas and water. Can we get back the wood immediately from carbon dioxide and water? We cannot. So, it is a permanent change. In most of the cases, we cannot. But some chemical reactions can be reversed. Our mobile phone gets energy from its lithium - ion battery by chemical reactions. It is called discharging. On recharging the mobile, these chemical reactions are reversed. Thus, chemical reactions may be reversed under suitable conditions. Hence, they are grouped into two categories such as reversible and irreversible reactions.\nReversible Reactions\nA reversible reaction is a reaction that can be reversed, i. e. , the products can be converted back to the reactants. A reversible reaction is represented by a double arrow with their heads in the direction opposite to each other. Thus, a reversible reaction can be represented by the following equation:\nExplanation: Here, the compound \u2018A B\u2019 undergoes decomposition to form the products \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019. It is the forward reaction. As soon as the products are formed, they combine together to form \u2018A B\u2019. It is the backward reaction. So, the reaction takes place in both the directions. Do you think then that no products are formed in the aforesaid reaction? If you think so, you are wrong. Because, even though the reaction takes place in both the directions, at the initial stage the rates (speed) of these reactions are not equal. Consider the following decomposition reaction of phosphorous pentachloride into phosphorous trichloride and chlorine.\nP Cl5(gas)undergoes reversible reaction and givesP Cl3(gas) + Cl2(gas)\nThe forward reaction is the decomposition of PCl5 and the backward reaction is the combination of PCl3 and Cl2. Initially, the forward reaction proceeds faster than the backward reaction. After some \u00d7 , the speed of both the reactions become equal. So, PCl5 cannot be completely converted into the products as the reaction is reversed. It is a reversible reaction. The actual measurements of the given reaction show that the reaction is at equilibrium, but the amount of PCl5 is more than that of P Cl3 and Cl2.\nMORE TO KNOW\nIf hydrogen peroxide is poured on a wound, it decomposes into water and oxygen. The gaseous oxygen bubbles away as it is formed and thus prevent the formation of H2O2.\nThus, more amount of products can be obtained in a reversible reaction by the periodical removal of one of the products or the periodical addition of the reactants.\n2H2O2(aqueous)under goes reversible reaction and gives 2H2O(liquid) + O2(gas)\nIrreversible Reactions\nThe reaction that cannot be reversed is called irreversible reaction. The irreversible reactions are unidirectional, i. e. , they take place only in the forward direction. Consider the combustion of coal into carbon dioxide and water.\nC(solid) + O2(gas)givesCO2(gas) + Heat\nCoal + Oxygen givesCarbon dioxide + heat.\nIn this reaction, solid coal burns with oxygen and gets converted into carbon dioxide gas and water. As the product is a gas, as soon as it is formed it escapes out of the reaction container. It is extremely hard to decompose a gas into a solid. Thus, the backward reaction is not possible in this case. So, it is an irreversible reaction. Table 10. 2 provides the main differences between a reversible and an irreversible reaction:\nTable 10. 2 Differences between reversible and irreversible reactions\nREVERSIBLE REACTION\nIRREVERSIBLE REACTION\nIt can be reversed under suitable conditions.\nIt cannot be reversed.\nBoth forward and backward\nreactions take place\nsimultaneously.\nIt is unidirectional. It proceeds only in forward direction.\nIt attains equilibrium.\nEquilibrium is not attained.\nThe reactants cannot be converted completely into products.\nThe reactants can becompletely convertedinto products.\nIt is relatively slow.\nIt is fast.\nYou will learn more about these reactions in your higher classes.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Let us consider the following reactions:\nRusting of iron\nDigestion of food\nBurning of petrol\nWeathering of rock\nHow fast is each reaction? Rank them from the slowest to fastest. How will you determine, which is the fastest and which is the slowest? One of the ways to find out how fast a reaction is as follows: Measure the number of reactants or products before and after a specific period of time. For example, let us assume that 100 gram of a substance \u2018A\u2019 undergoes a reaction and after an hour 50 gram of \u2018A\u2019 is left.\nA givesProduct\nIn another instance, 100 gram of substance \u2018C\u2019 undergoes a reaction and after an hour, 20 g of \u2018C\u2019 is left.\nC givesProduct\nCan you say which is the faster reaction? In the first reaction, 50 gram of the reactant (A) is converted into products whereas in the second reaction 80 gram of the reactant is converted into products in one hour. So, the second reaction is faster. This measurement is called \u2018the reaction rate\u2019.\n\u201cRate of a reaction is the change in the amount or concentration of any one of the reactants or products per unit time\u201d.\nConsider the following reactionAgives B\nThe rate of the reaction is given by\nrate = - d square (A / d t = + d square) of B / d t\nsquare bracket of A is concentration of A\nsquare bracket of B is concentration of B\nd t is change in time\nThe negative sign indicates the decrease in the concentration of A with time.\nThe positive sign indicates the increase in the concentration of B with time.\nNote: square bracket represents the concentration, \u2018d\u2019 represents the infinitesimal change in the concentration.\nWhy is reaction rate important?\nFaster the reaction, more will be the amount of the product in a specified time. So, the rate of a reaction is important for a chemist for designing a process to get a good yield of a product. Rate of reaction is also important for a food processor who hopes to slow down the reactions that cause food to spoil.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The rate of a reaction can be changed. For example, iron gets rusted faster in an acid than in water. Important factors that affect rate of a reaction are\n1. Nature of the reactants\n2. Concentration of the reactants\n3. Temperature\n4. Catalyst\n6. Surface area of the reactants\n(1) Nature of the reactants\nThe reaction of sodium with hydrochloric acid is faster than that with acetic acid. Do you know why? Hydrochloric acid is a stronger acid than acetic acid and thus more reactive. So, the nature of the reactants influences the reaction rate.\n2Na(solid) + 2HCl(aquoes) gives2NaCl(aqueous) + H2(g)(fast)\n2Na(solid) + 2CH3COOH(aqueous)gives 2CH3COONa(aqueous) + H2(gas)(slow)\n(ii) Concentration of the reactants\nChanging the amount of the reactants also increases the reaction rate. The amount of the substance present in a certain volume of the Solution is called \u2018concentration\u2019. More the concentration, more particles per volume exist in it and hence faster the reaction. Granulated zinc reacts faster with\n2M hydrochloric acid than 1M hydrochloric acid.\n(iii) Temperature\nMost of the reactions go faster at higher temperature. Because adding heat to the reactants provides energy to break more bonds and thus speed up the reaction. Calcium carbonate reacts slowly with hydrochloric acid at room temperature. When the reaction mixture is heated the reaction rate increases.\nDo You Know?\nFood kept at room temperature spoils faster than that kept in the refrigerator. In the refrigerator, the temperature is lower than the room temperature and hence the reaction rate is less.\n(iv) Pressure\nIf the reactants are gases, increasing their pressure increases the reaction rate. This is because, on increasing the pressure the reacting particles come closer and collide frequently.\n(5) Catalyst\nA catalyst is a substance which increases the reaction rate without being consumed in the reaction. In certain reactions, adding a substance as catalyst speeds up the reaction. For example, on heating potassium chlorate, it decomposes into potassium chloride and oxygen gas, but at a slower rate. If manganese dioxide is added, it increases the reaction rate.\n(vi) Surface area of the reactants\nWhen solid reactants are involved in a reaction, their powdered form reacts more readily. For example, powdered calcium carbonate reacts more readily with hydrochloric acid than marble chips. Because, powdering of the reactants increases the surface area and more energy is available on collision of the reactant particles. Thus, the reaction rate is increased.\nYou will study more about reaction rate in you higher classes.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

When the rate of the forward reaction becomes equal to the rate of backward reaction, then no more product is formed. This stage of the reaction is called \u2018equilibrium state\u2019. After this stage, no net change in the reaction can occur and hence in the amount of the reactants and products. Since this equilibrium is attained in a chemical reaction, it is called \u2018Chemical Equilibrium\u2019.\nChemical Equilibrium: It is state of a reversible chemical reaction in which no change in the amount of the reactants and products takes place. At equilibrium,\nRate of forward reaction = Rate of backward reaction.\nExplanation: Initially the rate of the forward reaction is greater than the rate of the backward reaction. However, during the course of reaction, the concentration of the reactants decreases and the concentration of the products increases. Since the rate of a reaction is directly proportional to the concentration, the rate of the forward reaction decreases with time, whereas the rate of the backward reaction increases.\nAt a certain stage, both the rates become equal. From this point onwards, there will be no change in the concentrations of both the reactants and the products with time. This state is called as equilibrium state.\nLet us consider the decomposition of calcium carbonate into lime and carbon dioxide. It is a reversible reaction. The speed of each reaction can be determined by how quickly the reactant disappears. If the reaction is carried out in a closed vessel, it reaches a chemical equilibrium. At this stage,\nC a C O3(solid) undergoes reversible reaction and givesCaO(solid) + C O2(gas)\nThe rate of decomposition of C a C O3 = The rate of combination of C a O and C O2\nNot only chemical changes, physical changes also may attain equilibrium. When water kept in a closed vessel evaporates, it forms water vapour. No water vapour escapes out of the container as the process takes place in a closed vessel. So, it builds up the vapour pressure in the container. At one time, the water vapour condenses back into liquid water and when the rate of this condensation becomes equal to that of vaporisation, the process attains equilibrium.\nAt this stage, the volume of the liquid and gaseous phases remains constant. Since it is a physical change, the equilibrium attained is called \u2018Physical Equilibrium\u2019. Physical equilibrium is a state of a physical change at which the volume of all the phases remains unchanged.\nH2O(liquid) undergoes condensation which is reversible and givesH2O(gas)\nFigure 10. 6 State of physical equilibrium\nCharacteristics of equilibrium\nIn a chemical equilibrium, the rates of the forward and backward reactions are equal.\nThe observable properties such as pressure, concentration, colour, density, viscosity etc. , of the system remain unchanged with time.\nThe chemical equilibrium is a dynamic equilibrium, because both the forward and backward reactions continue to occur even though it appears static externally.\nIn physical equilibrium, the volume of all the phases remain constant.\nDo You Know?\nAerated soft drinks contain dissolved carbon dioxide in a pop bottle (Soda). When the bottle is sealed, the dissolved carbon dioxide (in the form of carbonic acid) and gaseous C O2 are in equilibrium with each other. When you open the bottle, the gaseous C O2 can escape. So, the dissolved C O2 begins to undissolve back to the gas phase trying to replace the gas that was lost, when you opened the bottle. That\u2019s why if you leave it open long enough, it goes \u2018flat\u2019. All the CO2 will be gone, blown away in the air.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

This conductivity of water has resulted from the self - ionisation of water. Self - ionisation or auto ionisation is a reaction in which two like molecules react to give ions. In the process of ionisation of water, a proton from one water molecule is transferred to another water molecule leaving behind an O H negative ion. The proton gets dissolved in water forming the hydronium ion as shown in the following equation:\nThe hydronium ion formed is a strong acid and the hydroxyl ion is a strong base. So as fast as they are formed, they react again to produce water. Thus, it is a reversible reaction and attains equilibrium very quickly. So, the extent of ionisation is very little and the concentration of the ions produced is also very less. The product of the concentration of the hydronium ion and the hydroxyl ion is called\u2018ionic product of water\u2019. It is denoted as \u2018Kw\u2019. It is mathematically expressed as follows:\nK w = concentration of H3O + ion into concentration of O H negative ion.\nConcentrarion of H3O + ion may be simply written as concentration of H + ion. Thus the ionic product of water may also be expressed as\nK w = concentration of H + ion in to concentration of O H negative ion.\nIts unit is mol square deci meter ^ - 6. At 25\u00b0 C, its value is 1. 00 \u00d7 10^ - 14.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

In addition to this ionisation, substances dissolved in water also may produce hydrogen ions or hydroxyl ions. The concentration of these ions decides whether the Solution is acidic or basic. pH scale is a scale for measuring the hydrogen ion concentration in a Solution. The 'p' in pH stands for \u2018Potenz\u2019 in German meaning 'power'. pH notation was devised by the Danish biochemist Sorensen in 1909. pH scale is a set of numbers from 0 to 14 which is used to indicate whether a Solution is acidic, basic or neutral.\nAcids have pH less than 7\nBases have pH greater than 7\nA neutral Solution has pH equal to 7\nThe pH is the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration\nThat is pH = - log base 10 concentration of H + ion\nStomach acid\nLemon juice\nSoda, grapes\nHuman saliva\nTomato juice\nBlood plasma\nBaking soda\nAmmonia water\nDrain cleaner\nCaustic soda4%(NaOH)\nMilk of magnesia\nHow can we measure the pH of a given Solution using pH Paper\nThe pH of a Solution can be determined by using a universal indicator. It contains a mixture of dyes. It comes in the form of a Solution or a pH paper.\nFigure 10. 7 pH Indicator\nA more common method of measuring pH in a school laboratory is by using the pH paper. A pH paper contains a mixture of indicators. It shows a specific colour at a given pH. A colour guide is provided with the bottle of the indicator or the strips of paper impregnated with it, which are called pH paper strips. The test Solution is tested with a drop of the universal indicator, or a drop of the test Solution is put on the pH paper. The colour of the Solution on the pH paper is compared with the colour chart and the pH value is read from it. The pH values thus obtained are only approximate values.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Living organisms can survive only in a narrow range of pH change. Different body fluids have different pH values. For example, pH of blood is ranging from 7. 35 to 7. 45. Any increase or decrease in this value leads to diseases. The ideal pH for blood is 7. 4.\npH in our digestive system\nIt is very interesting to note that our stomach produces hydrochloric acid. It helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach. During indigestion the stomach produces too much acid and this causes pain and irritation. pH of the stomach fluid is approximately 2. 0.\npH changes as the cause of tooth decay\npH of the saliva normally ranges between6. 5 to 7. 5. White enamel coating of our teeth is calcium phosphate, the hardest substance in our body. When the pH of the mouth saliva falls below 5. 5, the enamel gets weathered. Toothpastes, which are generally basic are used for cleaning the teeth that can neutralise the excess acid and prevent tooth decay.\nIn agriculture, the pH of the soil is very important. Citrus fruits require slightly alkaline soil, while rice requires acidic soil and sugarcane requires neutral soil.\npH of rain water\nThe pH of rain water is approximately 7, which means that it is neutral and also represents its high purity. If the atmospheric air is polluted with oxide gases of sulphur and nitrogen, they get dissolved in the rain water and make its pH less than 7. Thus, if the pH of rain water is less than 7, then it is called acid rain. When acid rain flows into the rivers it lowers the pH of the river water also.\nThe survival of aquatic life in such rivers becomes difficult.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Because, the food we eat, medicines we take when ill, clothes we wear; domestic and automobile fuels, paint, cosmetics, automobile parts, etc. , that we use contain carbon compounds. The number of carbon compounds found in nature and man - made, is much higher than that of any other element in the periodic table. In fact there are more than 5 million compounds of carbon. The unique nature of carbon, such as catenation, tetravalency and multiple bonding, enables it to combine with itself or other elements like hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur etc. , and hence form large number of compounds. All these compounds are made of covalent bonds. These compounds are called organic compounds. In this lesson, you will learn about carbon compounds.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

There are millions of organic compounds known and many new organic compounds are discovered every year in nature or synthesized in laboratory. This may mystify organic chemistry to a large extent. However, a unique molecular structure can be assigned to each compound and it can be listed by using systematic methods of classification and eventually named on the basis of its structural arrangements. In early days, chemists recognised that compounds having similar structural features have identical chemical properties. So they began to classify compounds based on the common structural arrangements found among them.\nOrganic chemistry is the chemistry of catenated carbon compounds. The carbon atoms present in organic compounds are linked with each other through covalent bonds and thus exist as chains. By this way, organic compounds are classified into two types as follows:\n1. Acyclic or Open chain compounds: These are the compounds in which the carbon atoms are linked in a linear pattern to form the chain. If all the carbon atoms in the chain are connected by single bonds, the compound is called as saturated. If one or more double bonds or triple bonds exist between the carbon atoms, then the compound is said to unsaturated.\nPropanePropene\nSaturated compoundUnsaturated compound\n2. Cyclic Compounds: Organic compounds in which the chain of carbon atoms is closed or cyclic are called cyclic compounds. If the chain contains only carbon atoms, such compounds are called carbocyclic (homocyclic)compounds. If the chain contains carbon and other atoms like oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, etc. , these compounds are called heterocyclic compounds. Carbocyclic compounds are further subdivided into alicyclic and aromatic compounds. Alicyclic compounds contain one or more carbocyclic rings which may be saturated or unsaturated whereas aromatic compounds contain one or more benzene rings (ring containing alternate double bonds between carbon atoms).

The carbon atoms join together to form the framework of the compounds. These are regarded as the parent organic compounds and all other compounds are considered to be derived from hydrocarbons by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms with other atoms or group of atoms. Hydrocarbons are, further, sub divided into three classes such as:\n(a)Alkanes: These are hydrocarbons, which contain only single bonds. They are represented by the general formula Cn H 2n + 2 (where n = 1, 2, 3, . . . . . . ). The simplest alkane (for n = 1) is methane (C H4). Since, all are single bonds in alkanes, they are saturated compounds.\n(b)Alkenes: The hydrocarbons, which contain one or more C = C bonds are called alkenes. These are unsaturated compounds. They are represented by the general formula CnH2n. The simplest alkene contains two carbon atoms (n = 2) and is called ethylene (C2 H4).\n(c)Alkynes: The hydrocarbons containing carbon to carbon triple bond are called alkynes. They are also unsaturated as they contain triple bond between carbon atoms. They have the general formula Cn H 2n \u2013 2. Acetylene (C2 H2) is the simplest alkyne, which contains two carbon atoms. Table 11. 1 lists the first five hydrocarbons of each class:\nTable 11. 1 Hydrocarbons containing 1to 5 carbon atoms\nNumber of carbon atoms\nAlkane(CnH2n + 2)\nAlkene(Cn H2n)\n(CnH2n - 2)\nMethane(C H4)\nEthane(C2 H6)\nEthene(C2 H4)\nEthyne(C2 H2)\nPropane(C3 H8)\nPropene(C3 H6)\nPropyne(C3 H4)\nButane(C4 H10)\nButene(C4 H8)\nButyne(C4 H6)\nPentane(C5 H12)\nPentene(C5 H10)\nPentyne(C5 H8)\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

These groups are called functional groups.\nA functional group is an atom or group of atoms in a molecule, which gives its characteristic chemical properties.\nThe chemical properties of an organic compound depend on its functional group whereas its physical properties rely on remaining part of the structure. Carbon to carbon multiple bonds\n(C double bond C, C triple bond C) also are considered as functional groups as many of the properties are influenced by these bonds. Other functional groups include atoms of halogens, \u2013O H, \u2013C H O, \u2013COOH, etc.\nFor example, ethane is a hydrocarbon having molecular formula C2H6. If one of its hydrogens is replaced by \u2013O H group, you will get an alcohol. Leaving the functional group, the rest of the structure is represented by \u2018R\u2019. Thus an alcohol is represented by \u2018R - O H\u2019\nA series of compounds containing the same functional group is called a class of organic compounds. Table 11. 2 shows various classes or families of organic compounds and their functional groups:\nTable 11. 2 Classes of organic compounds based on functional group\nClassof thecompound\nFunctional group\nCommon Formula\nEthanol, CH3 CH2 O H\n- C double bond O - H\nAcetaldehyde, CH3 C H O\n\u2212C double bond O\nAcetone, CH3 C O CH3\nCarboxylicacids\nC double bond O \u2013 O H\nAceticacid, CH3 C O O H\nC dounle bond O O R\nMethyl acetate,\nCH3 C O O CH3\nDimethyl ether, CH3 O CH3\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

For example, the formic acid was initially obtained by distillation of \u2018red ants. Latin name of the red ant is \u2018Formica\u2019. So, the name of the formic acid was derived from the Latin name of its source Later, the organic compounds were synthesized from sources other than the natural sources. So scientists framed a systematic method for naming the organic compounds based on their structures. Hence, a set of rules was formulated by IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) for the nomenclature of chemical compounds.\n11. 5. 2 Components of an IUPAC name\nThe IUPAC name of the any organic compound consists of three parts:\n1. Root word\niii. Suffix\nThese parts are combined as per the following sequence to get the IUPAC name of the compound:\nPrefix + RootWord + Suffix givesIUPAC Name\n(1)Root word: It is the basic unit, which describes the carbon skeleton. It gives the number of carbon atoms present in the parent chain of the compound and the pattern of their arrangement. Based on the number of carbon atoms present in the carbon skeleton, most of the names are derived from Greek numerals (except the first four). Table 11. 3 shows the root words for the parent chain of hydrocarbons containing 1to10 carbon atoms:\nTable 11. 3 Root words of hydrocarbons\nNumber of carbon atoms\nTable 11. 4 Prefix for IUPAC Name\nSubstituent\nPrefix used\n(ii)Prefix:\nThe prefix represents the substituents or branch present in the parent chain. Atoms or group of atoms, other than hydrogen, attached to carbon of the parent chain are called substituents. Table 11. 4 presents the major substituents of organic compounds and respective prefix used for them\n(iii)Suffix\nThe suffix forms the end of the name. It is divided into two parts such as (a) Primary suffix and (b) Secondary suffix. The primary suffix comes after the root word. It represents the nature in carbon - to - carbon bonding of the parent chain. If all the bonds between the carbon atoms of the parent chain are single, then suffix \u2018ane\u2019 has to be used. Suffix \u2018ene\u2019 and \u2018yne\u2019 are used for the compounds containing double and triple bonds respectively. The secondary suffix describes the functional group of the compound.\nTable 11. 5 Suffix for IUPAC Name\nClassof theCompound\nFunctional group\nSuffix used\nC double bond O\nCarboxylicacids\nIUPAC rules for naming organic compounds:\nRule1: Identify the longest chain of carbon atoms to get the parent\u2019s name (root word).\nRule 2: Number the carbon atoms of the parent chain, beginning at the closest end of the substituent or functional group. These are called locant numbers. If both functional group and substituent are present, then the priority will be given to the functional group.\nRule 3: In case of alkenes and alkynes, locate the double bond or triple bond and use its locant number followed by a \u2014 and a primary suffix. The carbon chain is numbered in such a way that the multiple bonds have the lowest possible locant number.\nRule 4: If the compound contains functional group, locate it and use its locant number followed by a \u2014 and a secondary suffix.\nRule 5: When the primary and secondary suffixes are joined, the terminal \u2018e\u2019 of the primary suffix is removed.\nRule 6: Identify the substituent and use a number followed by a \u2014 and a prefix to specify its location and identity.\n11. 5. 4 IUPAC Nomenclature of hydrocarbons \u2013 Solved examples\nLet us try to name, systematically, some of the linear and substituted hydrocarbons by following IUPAC rules:\nExample 1: CH3 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH3\nStep 1: It is a five - carbon chain and hence the root word is \u2018Pent\u2019. (Rule 1)\nStep 2: All the bonds between carbon atoms are single bonds, and thus the suffix is \u2018ane\u2019.\nSo, its name is Pent + ane = Pentane\nCH3\u2212CH\u2212CH2\u2212CH2\u2212CH3and methyl group CH3 is located with second carbon atom of the chain.\nStep 1: The longest chain contains five carbon atoms and hence the root word is \u2018Pent\u2019.\nStep 2: There is a substituent. So, the carbon chain is numbered from the left end, which is\nclosest to the substituent. (Rule 2)\nCH3 \u2013 CH \u2212 CH2 \u2212 CH2 \u2212 CH3 and substituent methyl group is located at second carbon atom.\nStep 3: All are single bonds between the carbon atoms and thus the suffix is \u2018ane\u2019.\nStep 4: The substituent is a methyl group and it is located at second carbon atom. So, its locant number is 2. Thus the prefix is \u20182 - Methyl\u2019. (Rule 6).\nThe name of the compound is\n2 - Methyl + pent + ane = 2 - Methylpentane\nCH3\u2212CH2 - CH \u2212 CH2\u2212 CH2\u2212 CH2\u2212 CH3and substituent methyl group is located at third carbon atom.\nStep 1: The longest chain contains seven carbon atoms and hence the root word is \u2018Hept\u2019.\nStep 2: There is a substituent. So, the carbon chain is numbered from the end, which is closest to substituent. (Rule 2)\nStep 3: All are single bonds between the carbon atoms and thus the suffix is \u2018ane\u2019.\nStep 4: The substituent is a methyl group and it is located at third carbon. So, its locant number is 3. Thus the prefix is \u20183 - Methyl\u2019. (Rule 6)\nHence the name of the compound is\n3 - Methyl + hept + ane = 3 \u2013Methylheptane\nExample 4: CH3 - CH2 - CH2 - CH double bond CH2\nStep 1: It is a \u2018five - carbon atoms chain\u2019 and hence the root word is \u2018Pent\u2019. (Rule 1)\nStep 2: There is a carbon - to - carbon double bond. The suffix is \u2018ene\u2019.\nStep 3: The carbon chain is numbered from the end such that double bond has the lowest locant number as shown below: (Rule 3):\nCH3\u2212 CH2\u2212CH2\u2212 CH double bond CH2 number 1 2 3 4 5 given from right to left.\nStep 4: The locant number of the double bond is 1 and thus the suffix is \u2018 - 1 - ene\u2019.\nSo, thename of the compound is\nPent + ( - 1 - ene) = Pent - 1 - ene\n11. 5. 5 IUPAC Nomenclature of other classes \u2013 Solved examples\nExample1: CH3\u2212 CH2\u2212CH2\u2212 O H\nStep1: The parent chain consists of 3 carbon atoms. The root word is \u2018Prop\u2019.\nStep 2: There are single bonds between the carbon atoms of the chain. So, the primary suffix is \u2018ane\u2019.\nStep 3: Since, the compound contains \u2013 OH group, it is an alcohol. The carbon chain is numbered from the end which is closest to \u2013OH group.

Molasses is a dark coloured syrupy liquid left after the crystallization of sugar from the concentrated sugarcane juice. Molasses contains about 30% of sucrose, which cannot be separated by crystallization. It is converted into ethanol by the following steps:\n(i) Dilution of molasses\nMolasses is first diluted with water to bring down the concentration of sugar to about 8 to 10 percent.\n(ii) Addition of Nitrogen source\nMolasses usually contains enough nitrogenous matter to act as food for yeast during the fermentation process. If the nitrogen content of the molasses is poor, it may be fortified by the addition of ammonium sulphate or ammonium phosphate.\n(iii) Addition of Yeast\nThe Solution obtained in step (ii) is collected in large \u2018fermentation tanks and yeast are added to it. The mixture is kept at about 303 Kelvin for a few days. During this period, the enzymes invertase and zymase present in yeast, bring about the conversion of sucrose into ethanol.\nC12 H22 O11 (sugar) + H2O (water) in the presence of invertase gives C6H12 O6 (glucose) + C6 H12 O6(fructose)\nC6 H12 O6 (glucose or fructose) in the presence of zymase gives 2C2 H5 O H ethanol + 2 C O2\nThe fermented liquid is technically called wash.\n(iv) Distillation of 'Wash'\nThe fermented liquid (i. e. wash), containing 15 to 18 percent alcohol, is now subjected to fractional distillation. The main fraction drawn is an aqueous Solution of ethanol which contains 95. 5% of ethanol and 4. 5% of water. This is called rectified spirit. This mixture is then refluxed over quicklime for about 5 to 6 hours and then allowed to stand for 12 hours. On distillation of this mixture, pure alcohol (100%) is obtained. This is called absolute alcohol.\nMore to know\nYeast and Fermentation: Yeasts are single\u2013celled microorganisms, belonging to the class of fungi. The enzymes present in yeasts catalyse many complex organic reactions. Fermentation is conversion of complex organic molecules into simpler molecules by the action of enzymes. Example Curdling of milk\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

They contain \u2018surfactants\u2019, which are compounds with molecules that line up around water to break the \u2018surface tension\u2019. Both of them having a different chemical nature. Soap is a cleaning agent that is composed of one or more salts of fatty acids. Detergent is a chemical compound or a mixture of chemical compounds, which is used as a cleaning agent, also. They perform their cleaning actions in certain specific conditions. You will learn more about this in detail, in the following units.\n11. 9. 1 Soap\nSoaps are sodium or potassium salts of some long chain carboxylic acids, called fatty acids. Soap requires two major raw materials: i) fat and ii) alkali. The alkali, most commonly used in the preparation of soap is sodium hydroxide. Potassium hydroxide can also be used. A potassium - based soap creates a more water - soluble product than a sodium - based soap. Based on these features, there are two types of soaps:\nA. HARD SOAP\nSoaps, which are prepared by the saponification of oils or fats with caustic soda (sodium hydroxide), are known as hard soaps. They are usually used for washing purposes.\nB. SOFT SOAP\nSoaps, which are prepared by the saponification of oils or fats with potassium salts, are known as soft soaps. They are used for cleansing the body.\nManufacture of soap\nKETTLE PROCESS:\nThis is the oldest method. But, it is still widely used in the small scale preparation ofsoap. There are mainly, two steps to be followed in this process.\n1) Saponification of oil:\nThe oil, which is used in this process, is taken in an iron tank (kettle). The alkaline Solution (10%) is added into the kettle, a little in excess. The mixture is boiled by passing steam through it. The oil gets hydrolysed after several hours of boiling. This process is called Saponification\nii) Salting out of soap:\nCommon salt is then added to the boiling mixture. Soap is finally precipitated in the tank. After several hours the soap rises to the top of the liquid as a \u2018curdy mass\u2019. The neat soap is taken off from the top. It is then allowed to cool down.\nEffect of hard water on soap\nHard water contains calcium and magnesium ions (C a2 + and M g2 + ) that limit the cleaning action of soap. When combined with soap, hard water develops a thin layer (precipitates of the metal ions) called \u2018scum\u2019, which leaves a deposit on the clothes or skin and does not easily rinse away. Over time, this can lead to the deterioration of the fabric and eventually ruin the clothes. On the other hand, detergents are made with chemicals that are not affected by hard water.\nDo You Know?\nWhy ordinary soap is not suitable for using with hard water?\nOrdinary soaps when treated with hard water, precipitate as salts of calcium and magnesium. They appearat the surface of the cloth as sticky grey scum. Thus, the soaps cannot be used conveniently in hard water.\n11. 9. 2 Detergents\nDevelopment of synthetic detergents is a big achievement in the field of cleansing. These soaps possess the desirable properties of ordinary soaps and also can be used with hard water and in acidic Solutions. These are salts of sulphonic acids or alkyl hydrogen sulphates in comparison to soap, which are salts of carboxylic acids. The detergents do not form precipitates with C a 2 + and M g 2 + present in hard water. So, the cleansing action of detergents is better than that of soaps.\nPreparation of detergents\nDetergents are prepared by adding sulphuric acid to the processed hydrocarbon obtained from petroleum. This chemical reaction result in the formation of molecules similar to the fatty acid in soap. Then, an alkali is added to the mixture to produce the \u2018surfactant molecules\u2019, which do not bond with the minerals present in the hard water, thus preventing the formation of their precipitates.\nIn addition to a \u2018surfactant\u2019, the modern detergent contains several other ingredients. They are listed as follows:\n1) Sodium silicate, which prevents the corrosion and ensures that the detergent does not damage the washing machine.\nii) Fluorescent whitening agents that give a glow to the clothes.\niii) Oxygen bleaches, such as \u2018sodium perborate\u2019, enable the removal of certain stains from the cloth.\niv) Sodium sulphate is added to prevent the caking of the detergent powder.\n5) Enzymes are added to break down some stains caused by biological substances like blood and vegetable juice.\nvi) Certain chemicals that give out a pleasant smell are also added to make the clothes fragrant after they are washed with detergents.\n11. 8. 3Cleansing action of soap\n11. 8. 3Cleansing action of soap\nA soap molecule contains two chemically distinct parts that interact differently with water. It has one polar end, which is a short head with a carboxylate group (\u2013COONa) and one non - polar end having the long tail made of the hydrocarbon chain.\nThe polar end is hydrophilic (Water loving) in nature and this end is attracted towards water. The non - polar end is hydrophobic (Water hating) in nature and it is attracted towards dirt or oil on the cloth, but not attracted towards water. Thus, the hydrophobic part of the soap molecule traps the dirt and the hydrophilic part makes the entire molecule soluble in water.\nWhen a soap or detergent is dissolved in water, the molecules join together as clusters called \u2018micelles\u2019. Their long hydrocarbon chains attach themselves to the oil and dirt. The dirt is thus surrounded by the non - polar end of the soap molecules (Figure 11. 3). The charged carboxylate end of the soap molecules makes the micelles soluble in water. Thus, the dirt is washed away with the soap.\nAdvantages of detergents over soaps\nDetergents are better than soaps because they:\ncan be used in both hard and soft water and can clean more effectively in hard water than soap.\ncan also be used in saline and acidic water.\ndo not leave any soap scum on the tub or clothes.\ndissolve freely even in cool water and rinse freely in hard water.\ncan be used for washing woollen garments, where as soap cannot be used.\nhave a linear hydrocarbon chain, which is biodegradable.\nare active emulsifiers of motor grease.\ndo an effective and safe cleansing, keeping even synthetic fabrics brighter and whiter.\nBiodegradable and Non - biodegradable detergents:\na) Biodegradable detergents:\nThey have straight hydrocarbon chains, which can be easily degraded by bacteria.\nFigure 11. 3 Cleansing action of soap\nb) Non - biodegradable detergents:\nThey have highly branched hydrocarbon chains, which cannot be degraded by bacteria.\nDisadvantages of Detergents\nSome detergents having a branched hydro - carbon chain are not fully biodegradable by\nmicro - organisms present in water. So, they cause water pollution.\n2.

Photosynthetic pigments are of two classes namely, the primary pigments and accessory pigments. chlorophyll (a )is the primary pigment that traps solar energy and converts it into electrical and chemical energy. Thus, it is called the reaction centre. Other pigments such as chlorophyll b and carotenoids are called accessory pigments as they pass on the absorbed energy to chlorophyll a (Chl. a) molecule. Reaction centres (primary pigments and harvesting centre) (accessory pigments) together form photo systems.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The structure of chloroplast is such that the light dependent (Light reaction) and light independent (Dark reaction) take place at different sites in the organelle\nThis was discovered by Robin Hill (1939). This reaction takes place in the presence of light energy in thylakoid membranes (grana) of the chloroplasts. Photosynthetic pigments absorb the light energy and convert it into chemical energy ATP and NADPH + H + . These products of light reaction move out from the thylakoid to the stroma of the chloroplast.\nMore to Know\nAdenosine Triphosphate\nAdenosine Diphosphate\nNicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide\nNicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate\nDo you Know?\nA cell cannot get its energy directly from glucose. So, in respiration the energy released from glucose is used to make ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)\nDark reaction or biosynthetic pathway takes place in stroma. During this reaction C O2 is reduced into carbohydrates with the help of light generated ATP and N A DPH + H + . This is also called as Calvin cycle and is carried out in the absence of light. It is called dark reaction.\nIn Calvin cycle the inputs are CO2 from the atmosphere and the ATP and NADPH + H + produced from light reaction.\nFigure 12. 9 Overview of Hill and Calvin cycle\nMelvin Calvin, an American biochemist, discovered chemical pathway for photosynthesis. The cycle is named as Calvin cycle. He was awarded with Nobel Prize in the year 1961 for his discovery.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Each membrane is 60 to 70 Angstrom thick. Outer mitochondrial membrane is smooth and freely permeable to most small molecules. It contains enzymes, proteins and lipids. It has porin molecules (proteins) which form channels for passage of molecules through it.\nInner mitochondrial membrane is semi permeable membrane and regulates the passage of materials into and out of the mitochondria. It is rich in enzymes and carrier proteins. It consists of 80% proteins and lipids.\nFigure 12. 10 Structure of Mitochondria\nCristae: The inner mitochondrial membrane gives rise to finger like projections called cristae.

It occurs in most plants and animals.\nGlycolysis (Glucose splitting):\nIt is the breakdown of one molecule of glucose (6 carbon) into two molecules of pyruvic acid (3 carbon). Glycolysis takes place in cytoplasm of the cell. It is the first step of both aerobic and anaerobic respiration.\nKrebs Cycle: This cycle occurs in mitochondria matrix. At the end of glycolysis, 2 molecules of pyruvic acid enter into mitochondria. The oxidation of pyruvic acid into C O2 and water takes place through this cycle. It is also called Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle (TCA).\nElectron Transport Chain: This is accomplished through a system of electron carrier complex called electron transport chain (E T C) located on the inner membrane of the mitochondria. NADH + H + and FADH2 molecules formed during glycolysis and Krebs cycle are oxidised to N A D + and F A D to release the energy via electrons. The electrons, as they move through the system, release energy which is trapped by ADP to synthesize ATP. This is called oxidative phosphorylation. In this process, O2 the ultimate acceptor of electrons gets reduced to water.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

It becomes ribbon shaped when extended and almost cylindrical when contracted. Leeches may grow to a length of 35cm.\nColouration: Dorsal surface is olive green in colour and the ventral surface is orange yellow or orange red in colour.\nSegmentation: Metamerism is the segmentation of the body. The body of leech is metamerically divided into 33 segments. The segments are arranged one behind the other. Each segment is further superficially subdivided into rings or annuli. A temporary clitellum is formed on segments 9 - 11, which is meant to produce a cocoon during the breeding season.\nReceptors: On the dorsal side there are five pairs of eyes on the first five segments. Each segment bears a number of sensory projections called receptors. Annular receptors are located in each annulus and segmental receptors are located on the first annulus of each segment.\nFigure 13. 1 External morphology of Leech\n1 Dorsal View\n2Ventral view\nSuckers: Leech has two suckers. The sucker located at the anterior end is called anterior sucker or oral sucker which is ventral in position occupying the first five segments. The posterior sucker is formed by the fusion of the last seven segments. The anterior sucker helps in feeding, while both the suckers help in attachment and locomotion.\nExternal apertures\nMouth: It is located in the middle of anterior sucker.\nAnus: Anus is a small aperture that opens on the mid - dorsal side of 26th segment.\n3 Nephridiopores: Nephridia open to the exterior by 17 pairs of nephridiopores. They lie ventrally on the last annulus of each segment from 6 to 22.\nMale genital pore: It is a mid - ventral opening, situated between second and third annuli of 10thsegment.\nFemale genital pore: It lies mid - ventrally between second and third annuli of 11th segment.\nObserve the external morphology of leech specimen in your biology laboratory.\nCan you find leeches in your locality?\nIn which geographical areas are leeches found more predominantly in India?\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Mouth is a triradiate aperture situated in the middle of the anterior sucker that leads into the small buccal cavity. The wall of the buccal cavity bears three jaws with single row of minute teeth. The jaws are provided with papillae which bear the openings of salivary glands. Mouth and buccal cavity occupy the first five segments.\nThe buccal cavity leads into muscular pharynx. It is surrounded by salivary glands. The secretion of saliva contains hirudin which prevents the coagulation of blood. Pharynx leads into crop through a short and narrow oesophagus.\nCrop is the largest portion of the alimentary canal. It is divided into a series of 10 chambers. The chambers communicate with one another through circular apertures surrounded by sphincters. A pair of laterals, backwardly directed caecae arises as blind outgrowth from each chamber known as caeca or diverticula. Crop and its diverticula can store large amount of blood which can be slowly digested.\nThe last chamber of crop opens into stomach. The stomach leads into intestine which is a small straight tube that opens into rectum. The rectum opens to the exterior by anus.\nFood, Feeding and Digestion\nThe leech feeds by sucking the blood of cattle and other domestic animals. During feeding the leech attaches itself to its victim strongly by the posterior sucker. The leech makes a triradiate or Y shaped incision in the skin of the host by the jaws protruded through the mouth. The blood is sucked by muscular pharynx and the salivary secretion is poured.\nThe ingested blood is stored in crop chambers and its diverticulum. The blood passes from the crop into the stomach. Digestion takes place in stomach by the action of proteolytic enzyme. The digested blood is then absorbed slowly by the intestine. Undigested food is stored in rectum and egested through anus.\nLeeches prevent blood clotting by secreting a protein called hirudin. They also inject an anaesthetic substance that prevents the host from feeling their bite.\nFigure 13. 2 Digestive system of Leech\nMore to Know\nLeeches do not have ear, hence can sense vibrations through their skin.\nLeeches have 2 to 10 tiny eyes, which helps them to locate their food.\nLeeches can suck blood five \u00d7 more than their body weight. It may take more than a year for the complete digestion and absorption of a full meal.\nTable 13. 1 Segmentation of Leech\nExternal andInternal features\nSegments in which the structures are present\nBody segments\nAnterior Sucker, Mouth, Eyes\nPosterior sucker\ntwenty seventh to 33\nFifth to eighth\nNinth to eighteenth\nTenth to twenty second\nTwenty third to twenty sixth\ntwenty sixth\nNephridiopores\nsixthtotwenty second\nMale genitalaperture\nFemale genital aperture\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

There are no true blood vessels. The blood vessels are replaced by channels called haemocoelic channels or canals filled with blood like fluid.

They are in the form of spherical sacs called testes sacs. From each testis arises a short duct called vas deferens, which join with the vas deferens. The vas deferens becomes convoluted to form the epididymis or sperm vesicle, to store spermatozoa.\nThe epididymis leads to a short duct called ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory ducts on both sides join to form the genital atrium. The atrium consists of two regions, the coiled prostate glands and the penial sac consisting of penis that opens through the male genital pore.\nFemale Reproductive System\nIt consists of ovaries, oviducts and vagina. There is a single pair of ovaries in the 11th segment on the ventral side. Each ovary is a coiled ribbon - shaped structure.\nThe ova are budded off from the ovary. From each ovary runs a short oviduct. The oviducts of the two sides joins together, to form a common oviduct. The common oviduct opens into a pear - shaped vagina which lies mid - ventrally in the posterior part of the 11th segment.\nDevelopment\nInternal fertilization takes place. This is followed by cocoon formation. Cocoon is also known as egg case which is formed around the 9th, 10th and 11th segments.\nDevelopment is direct and proceeds in cocoon which contain one to 24 embryos.\nYoung leech resembling the adult emerges.\nFigure 13. 4 Reproductive system of Leech\nMore to Know\nMedicinal value of Leech\nLeeches are effective in increasing blood circulation and breaking up blood clots. It is surprising that they can be used to treat cardiovascular diseases. Biochemical substances derived from leech saliva are used for preparation of pharmaceutical drugs that can treat hypertension.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Males and females are of the same size. They grow about 45 cm in length and weigh about 2. 25 kg as adult. The colour varies from white to black and white. Body is covered with fur which serves to keep it warm.\nBody - division: The body of the rabbit is divisible into the head, neck, trunk and tail.\nHead: Head is ovoid, flattened and bears a truncate snout. It contains mouth, external nares, eyes, ears and vibrissae. The mouth is a transverse slit - like bounded by upper lip and lower lip. Just above the mouth are two oblique openings called nostrils. From each side of the upper lip tactile hairs or vibrissae (whiskers) project outwards. A pair of large, movable external ear or pinnae is situated at the top of the head.\nNeck: The neck connects the head with the trunk. It helps to turn the head.\nTrunk: The trunk is divisible into an anterior thorax and a posterior abdomen. In females, four or five teats or nipples are present on the ventral surface between the thorax and abdomen.\nThe trunk bears two pairs of pentadactyl limbs. The forelimbs are shorter than the hind limbs. All the digits bear claws.\nThe anus is present at the posterior end of the abdomen at the base of tail. In females on the ventral side a slit like vulva is present. In male\u2019s penis is present in the ventral side of anus. The male has a pair of testes enclosed by scrotal sacs.\nTail: The tail is short. It is used to give signals to other rabbits in the event of danger.\nIn tegument (Skin): The in tegument forms the outer covering of the body. The structures which are derived from it are hairs, claws, nails and glands like sweat glands, sebaceous glands and\nmammary glands.\nMammary glands are modified glands of the skin. They secrete milk and help in nourishing young ones. The sweat glands and sebaceous glands embedded in the skin regulate the body temperature.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The alimentary canal consists of mouth, buccal cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, caecum, large intestine and anus.\nMouth is a transverse slit bounded by upper and lower lips. It leads into the buccal cavity. The floor of the buccal cavity is occupied by a muscular tongue. Jaws bear teeth.\nThe buccal cavity leads into the oesophagus through the pharynx. Oesophagus opens into the stomach followed by small intestine. Caecum is a thin - walled sac present at the junction of small intestine and large intestine. It contains bacteria that helps in digestion of cellulose. The small intestine opens into the large intestine which has colon and rectum. The rectum finally opens outside by the anus.\nDigestive glands\nThe digestive glands are salivary glands, gastric glands, liver, pancreas and intestinal glands. The secretions of digestive glands help in digestion of food in the alimentary canal.\nDentition in Rabbit\nTeeth are hard bone - like structures used to cut, tear and grind the food materials. The rabbit has two sets of teeth. The existence of two sets of teeth in the life of an animal is called diphyodont dentition. The two types of teeth are milk teeth (young ones) and permanent teeth (in adults).\nFigure 13. 6 Digestive System of Rabbit\nIn rabbit the teeth are of different types. Hence, the dentition is called heterodont. There are four kinds of teeth in mammals namely. the incisors (I), canines (C), premolars (PM) and molars (M). This is expressed in the form of a dental formula.\nFigure 13. 7 Dentition of Rabbit (Arrangement of teeth in jaws)\nDental formula is the simple method of representing the teeth of a mammal. The number of each kind of tooth in the upper and the lower jaws on one side is counted.\nDental formula is: I(2 by 1), C (0 by 0), PM (3 by 2), M (3 by 3).\nin rabbit which is written as2033 by 1023. Canines are absent. The gap between the incisors and premolar is called diastema. It helps inmastication and chewing of food in herbivorous animals.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The thoracic cavity is bound dorsally by the vertebral column and ventrally by the sternum, laterally by the ribs. On the lower side of the thoracic cavity is the dome shaped diaphragm.\nFigure. 13. 8 Lungs of Rabbit\nEach lung is enclosed by a double membranous pleura. Atmospheric air passes through the external nostril and nasal passages into the pharynx. From the pharynx it passes through the glottis into the windpipe.\nThe anterior part of the windpipe is enlarged to form the larynx or voice box with its wall supported by four cartilaginous plates. Inside the larynx lies the vocal cord and its vibrations result in the production of sound. The larynx leads into trachea or windpipe.\nTracheal walls are supported by rings of cartilage which help in the free passage of air. The epiglottis prevents the entry of food into the trachea through the glottis. The trachea divides into two branches called the bronchi one entering into each lung and dividing into further branches called bronchioles which end in alveoli.\nThe respiratory events consist of inspiration (breathing in) and expiration (breathing out) allowing exchange of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide). Inspiration is an active process while expiration is a passive process.\nFigure. 13. 9 Heart of Rabbit \u2013 Ventral View\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The right and left auricles are separated by interarticular septum, similarly right and left ventricles are separated by interventricular septum.\nThe right auricle opens into the right ventricle by right auriculoventricular aperture, guarded by a tricuspid valve. The left auricle opens into the left ventricle by left auriculoventricular aperture guarded by a bicuspid valve or mitral valve. The opening of the pulmonary artery and aorta are guarded by three semilunar valves.\nThe right auricle receives deoxygenated blood through two precaval (superior vena cava) and one postcaval (inferior vena cava) veins from all parts of the body. The left auricle receives oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins from the lungs.

Therefore, they are usually described as urinogenital system in vertebrates.\nExcretory system\nEach kidney is made of several nephrons. It separates the nitrogenous wastes from blood and excretes it in the form of urea. Kidneys are dark red, bean shaped organs situated in the abdominal cavity. From each kidney arises the ureters which open posteriorly into the urinary bladder and leads into a thick - walled muscular duct called urethra.\nReproductive System\nSexual dimorphism is exhibited in rabbits. The male and female sexes are separate and are morphologically different.\nMale Reproductive system\nThe male reproductive system of rabbit consists of a pair of testes which are ovoid in shape. Testes are enclosed by scrotal sacs in the abdominal cavity. Each testis consists of numerous fine tubules called seminiferous tubules. This network of tubules leads into a coiled tubule called epididymis, which lead into the sperm duct called vas deferens. The vas deferens join in the urethra just below the urinary bladder. The urethra runs backward and passes into the penis.\nThere are three accessory glands namely prostate gland, Cowper\u2019s gland and perineal gland. Their secretions are involved in reproduction.\nFemale reproductive system\nThe female reproductive system of rabbit consists of a pair of ovaries which are small ovoid structures. They are located behind the kidneys in the abdominal cavity.\nA pair of oviducts opens into the body cavity by a funnel shaped opening from each side of the ovary. The anterior part of the oviduct is the fallopian tube. It leads into a wider tube called the uterus. The uterus joins together to form a median tube called vagina. The common tube is formed by the union of urinary bladder and the vagina and is called the urinogenital canal or vestibule. It runs backwards and opens to the exterior by a slit - like aperture called vulva.\nA pair of Cowper\u2019s gland and perineal gland are the accessory glands present in the female reproductive system.\nFigure. 13. 12 Female reproductive system of Rabbit\nPoints to Remember\nLeech is metamerically segmented and has 33 segments.\nIt has two suckers which are used to attach to the body of the host. It is also involved in locomotion.\nThe salivary glands of leech produce an anticoagulating substance called hirudin.\nLeech is a hermaphrodite.\nRabbits are warm blooded vertebrates.\nCanine teeth are absent in rabbit.\nRespiration takes place through a pair of lungs in rabbit.\nThe heart is four chambered consisting of two auricles and two ventricles.\nUrinogenital system comprises the urinary (or) excretory system and the genital (or) reproductive system.\nMammary glands are modified glands of the skin and help in nourishing the young ones.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

This process is carried out till an equilibrium is reached. Osmosis is the passive movement of water or any other solvent molecules.\nPlasmolysis\nIt occurs when a living plant cell is placed in a hypertonic Solution water molecule moves out of the cell and resulting in the shrinkage of protoplasm away from the cell wall.\nFigure 14. 2 Plasmolysis\nDemonstration of Osmosis\nA thistle funnel whose mouth is covered with a semipermeable membrane, is filled with sucrose Solution. It is kept inverted in a beaker containing water. The water will diffuse across the membrane due to osmosis and raise the level of the Solution in the funnel.\nImbibition is a type of diffusion in which a solid plant material absorbs water and gets swelled up.\nExample absorption of water by dry seeds and grapes.

Stomata are open in the day and closed at night. The opening and closing of the stomata is due to the change in turgidity of the guard cells. When water enters into the guard cells, they become turgid and the stoma open. When the guard cells lose water, it becomes flaccid and the stoma closes.\nFigure. 14. 6 Process of Transpiration\nWater evaporates from mesophyll cells of leaves through the open stomata, this lowers water concentration in mesophyll cells. As a result, more water is drawn into these cells from the xylem present in the veins through the process of osmosis. As water is lost from the leaves, pressure is created at the top to pull more water from the xylem to the mesophyll cells, this process is called transpiration pull. This extends up to the roots causing the roots to absorb more water from the soil to ensure continuous flow of water from the roots to the leaves.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

All minerals cannot be passively absorbed by the roots. Two factors account for this: 1 minerals are present in the soil as charged particles (ions) that cannot move across cell membranes and 2 the concentration of minerals in the soil is usually lower than the concentration of minerals in the root. Therefore, most minerals enter the root by active absorption through the cytoplasm of epidermal cells. This needs energy in the form of ATP. Then it is transported to all parts by transpiration pull.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Phloem tissue is composed of sieve tubes which have sieve plates. Cytoplasmic strands pass through the pores in the sieve plates.\nPhloem transports food (sucrose) from a source to a sink. The source is part of the plant that synthesize food, that is the leaf, and sink, is the part that needs or stores the food. But the source and sink may be reversed depending on the season, or the plant\u2019s need.\nSince the source - sink relationship is variable, the direction of movement in the phloem can be upwards or downwards, that is, bidirectional. In contrast, the movement is always unidirectional in xylem that is upwards.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Sucrose moves into the companion cells, then into the living phloem sieve tube cells by active transport. This process produces a hypertonic condition in the phloem. Water in the adjacent xylem moves into the phloem by osmosis. As osmotic pressure builds up, the phloem sap moves to areas of lower pressure. By active transport sucrose moves into the cells where it is utilised or stored. As sugars are removed, the osmotic pressure decreases, and water moves out of the phloem.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

A number of factors play a role in ascent of sap, and it takes places in following steps\nFigure 14. 8 Ascent of Sap\n1 Root Pressure: Water from soil enters the root hairs due to osmosis. Root pressure is responsible for movement of water up to the base of the stem.\n2 Capillary Action: Water or any liquid rises in a capillary tube because of physical forces, this phenomenon is called capillary action. In the same way, in stem water rises up to certain height because of capillary action.\n3 Adhesion - cohesion of Water Molecules: Water molecules form a continuous column in the xylem because of forces of adhesion and cohesion among the molecules.\n4 Cohesion: The force of attraction between molecules of water is called cohesion.\n5 Adhesion: The force of attraction between molecules of different substances is called adhesion. Water molecules stick to a xylem because of force of adhesion.\nMore to Know\nDews are water droplets on the leaves of grass seen in the early mornings, when the climate is humid and excess of water is present in the plants, the excess water is exudated in the form of liquid. This is due to root pressure. This phenomenon is called Guttation which takes place through specialized cells called Hydathodes.\nTranspiration Pull: Transpiration through stomata creates vacuum which creates a suction. called transpiration pull. The transpiration pull sucks the water column from the xylem tubes and thus water is able to rise to great heights even in the tallest plants.\nDemonstration of Root Pressure\nChoose a small soft stemmed plant. Cut the stem horizontally near the base with a blade in the morning. You will see drops of Solution oozing out of the cut stem due to root pressure.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

It is a red coloured fluid connective tissue.\nComponents of Blood: The blood consists of two main components. The fluid plasma and the formed elements (blood cells) which are found suspended in the plasma.\nPlasma: It is slightly alkaline, containing non - cellular substance which constitutes about 55% of the blood. Organic substances like proteins, glucose, urea, enzymes, hormones, vitamins and minerals are present in the plasma.\nFormed Elements of Blood: Blood corpuscles are of three types\n(1). Red blood corpuscles(RBC) or Erythrocytes\n(2). White blood corpuscles(WBC) or Leucocytes\n(3). Blood plateletsor Thrombocytes.\nRed blood corpuscles (Erythrocytes)\nThey are the most abundant cells in the human body. RBCs are formed in the bone marrow. The RBCs impartred colour to the blood due to presence of respiratory pigment haemoglobin. Matured mammalian RBCs do not have cell organelles and nucleus. They are biconcave and disc shaped. Their life span is about 120 days. RBC is involved in the transport of oxygen from lungs to tissues.\nErythrocytes\nDo You Know\nWhy does mammalian RBC lack cell organelles and nucleus?\nMammalian RBC lack nucleus and makes the cells biconcave and increase surface area for oxygen binding, loss of mitochondria allows the RBC to transport all the oxygen to tissues, and loss of endoplasmic reticulum allows more flexibility for RBC to move through the narrow capillaries.\nWhite blood corpuscles (Leucocytes)\nWBCs are colourless. They do not have haemoglobin and are nucleated cells. It is found in the bone marrow, spleen, thymus and lymph nodes. They are capable of amoeboid movement\nFigure 14. 9 Leucocytes\nThe white blood corpuscles can be grouped into two categories:\nGranulocytes\nAgranulocytes.\nGranulocytes\nThey contain granules in their cytoplasm. Their nucleus is irregular or lobed. The granulocytes are of three types\nNeutrophils\nEosinophils\n1 Neutrophils\nThey are large in size and have a 2 to 7 lobed nucleus. These corpuscles from 60% to 65% of the total leucocytes. Their numbers are increased during infection and inflammation.\n2 Eosinophils\nIt has a bilobed nucleus and constitute 2% to 3% of the total leucocytes. Their number increases during conditions of allergy and parasitic infections. It brings about detoxification of toxins.\n3 Basophils\nBasophils have lobed nucleus. They from 0. 5 to 1. 0% of the total leucocytes. They release chemicals during the process of inflammation.\nAgranulocytes\nGranules are not found in the cytoplasm of these cells. The agranulocytes are of two types:\nLymphocytes\n1 Lymphocytes\nThese are about 20 to 25% of the total leucocytes. They produce antibodies during bacterial and viral infections.\n2 Monocytes\nThey are the largest of the leucocytes and are amoeboid in shape. These cells from 5 to 6 % of the total leucocytes. They are phagocytic and can engulf bacteria.\nBlood Platelets or Thrombocytes\nThese are small and colourless. They do not have nucleus. There are about 2 lakh 50 thousand\nto 4 lakh platelets per cubic mm of blood. Life span of Thrombocytes platelets is 8 to 10 days. They play an important role in clotting of blood. Platelets form clot at the site of injury and prevent blood loss\nThrombocytes\nMore to Know\nAnaemia: Decrease in number of erythrocytes.\nLeucocytosis: Increase in the number of leukocytes.\nLeukopenia: Decrease in number of leukocytes.\nThrombocytopenia: Decrease in the number of thrombocytes.\nFunctions of blood\nTransportof respiratory gases (Oxygenand C O2).\nTransport of digestedfood materials to the different body cells.\nTransport of hormones.\nTransport ofnitrogenousexcretoryproducts like ammonia, urea and uric acid.\nIt is involved in protection of the body and defense against diseases.\nIt acts as buffer and also helps in regulation of pH and body temperature.\nIt maintains properwater balance in the body.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

There are three types of blood vessels namely arteries, veins and capillaries\nArteries: They are thick and elastic vessels that carry blood away from the heart to various organs of the body. All arteries carry oxygenated blood except the pulmonary artery which carry deoxygenated blood to the lungs.\nVeins: Veins are thin and non - elastic vessels that transport blood to the heart from the different organs.

Human heart is situated between the lungs, slightly tilted toward the left and above the diaphragm in the thoracic cavity. The heart is made of specialized type of muscle called the cardiac muscle.\nThe heart is enclosed in a double walled sac called pericardium. It contains lubricating pericardial fluid which reduces friction during heartbeat and protects it from mechanical injuries.\nFigure 14. 11 External structure of human heart\nThe human heart is four chambered. The two upper thin - walled chambers of the heart are called auricle or atria (sing: atrium) and two lower thick - walled chambers are called ventricles. The chambers are separated by partition called septum. The septum between auricles and ventricles prevents the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.\nThe two auricles are separated from each other by interatrial septum. The left atrium is smaller than the right atrium. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from different parts of the body through the main vein\u2019s superior vena cava, inferior vena cava and coronary sinus. Pulmonary veins bring oxygenated blood to the left atrium from the lungs. The right and left auricles pump blood into the right and left ventricles respectively.\nThe ventricles form the lower part of the heart. The two ventricles are separated from each other by an interventricular septum. The left and right ventricles have thick walls because the ventricles have to pump out blood with force away from the heart. From the right ventricle arises the pulmonary trunk which bifurcates to form right and left pulmonary arteries. The right and left pulmonary arteries supply deoxygenated blood to the lungs of the respective side. The left ventricle is longer and narrower than the right ventricle. The walls are about three \u00d7 thicker than the right ventricle. The left ventricle gives rise to aorta. The oxygenated blood is supplied by the aorta to various organs of the body. The coronary arteries supply blood to the heart.\nFigure 14. 12 INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF HUMAN HEART\nValves: The valves are the muscular flaps that regulate the flow of blood in a single direction and prevent back flow of blood. The heart contains three types of valves.\nRight atrioventricular valve: It is located between the right auricle and right ventricle. It has three thin triangular leaf like flaps and therefore called tricuspid valve. The apices of the flaps are held in position by chordae tendinea arising from the muscular projection of the ventricle wall known as papillary muscles.\nLeft atrioventricular valve: It is located between the left auricle and left ventricle. It has two cusps and therefore called bicuspid or mitral valve.\nMore to Know\nHeart chambers in vertebrate animals\nTwo chambered: Fishes\nThree chambered: Amphibians\nIncomplete Four chambered: Reptiles\nFour chambered: Aves, Mammals and Crocodiles (Reptile)\nSemilunar valves: The major arteries (pulmonary artery and aorta) which leave the heart have semilunar valves which prevent backward flow of blood into the ventricles. They are the pulmonary and aortic semilunar valves.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Aorta carries oxygenated blood to all the organs of the body.\nPulmonary circulation: The path of pulmonary circulation starts in the right ventricle. Pulmonary artery arises from the right ventricle and reaches the lungs with deoxygenated blood. Pulmonary veins collect the oxygenated blood from the lungs and supplies it to the left atrium of the heart.\nCoronary circulation: The supply of blood to the heart muscles (cardiac muscles) is called as coronary circulation. Cardiac muscles receive oxygenated blood from coronary arteries that originate from the aortic arch. Deoxygenated blood from the cardiac muscles drains into the right atrium by the coronary sinuses.\nWhen the blood circulates twice through the heart in one complete cycle it is called double circulation. In double circulation the oxygenated blood do not mix with the deoxygenated blood.\nHowever, in some animals the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are mixed and pass through the heart only once. This type of circulation is called single circulation. Example fishes, amphibians and certain reptiles.\nFigure 14. 13 Systemic and Pulmonary circulation\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The heart normally beats 72 \u2013 75 \u00d7 per minute.\nMore to Know\nNeurogenic and Myogenic Heartbeat\nNeurogenic heartbeat is initiated by a nerve impulse caused from a nerve ganglion situated near the heart. Example Annelids, most arthropods\nMyogenic heartbeat is initiated by a specialized group of modified heart muscle fibres. example Mollusca and Vertebrates\nInitiation and conduction of Heartbeat\nThe human heart is myogenic in nature. Contraction is initiated by a specialized portion of the heart muscle, the Sino - atrial (S A) node which is situated in the wall of the right atrium near the opening of the superior vena cava. The S A node is broader at the top and tapering below. It is made up of thin fibres.\nSino - atrial node acts as the \u2018pacemaker\u2019 of the heart because it is capable of initiating impulse which can stimulate the heart muscles to contract. The impulse from the sinoatrial node spreads as a wave of contraction over the right and left atrial wall pushing the blood through the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles. The wave of contraction from S A node reaches the atrioventricular (AV) node which is stimulated to emit an impulse of contraction spreading to the ventricular muscle via the atrioventricular bundle and the Purkinje fibres.\nDo You Know\nAtrioventricular bundle was discovered by His (1893). So is called Bundle of His.\nPulse: When the heart beats the blood is forced into the arteries. The expansion of the artery every time the blood is forced into it is called pulse. It can be felt by placing the fingertip on the artery near the wrist. Normal pulse rate ranges from 70 \u2013 90 PER minute.\nActivity 3Determining Heart Rate\nStopwatch or Stop clock.\nHave your partner to find the pulse in your wrist and count your heartbeats for 15 seconds while you are seated. Calculate your resting heart rate in beats per minute.\nHave your partner to count your heart beats for 15 seconds after you jog or run for 5 minutes. Calculate your heart rate in beats per minute.\nWhat causes your pulse?\nWhat causes the change in your heartbeat rate in each situation?\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The blood pressure is high in the arteries gradually drops in the arterioles and capillaries and become very low in the veins.\nBlood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure and diastolic pressure.\nSystolic pressure: During ventricular systole, the left ventricle contracts and forces blood into the aorta. The pressure rises to a peak which is referred as systolic pressure.\nDiastolic pressure: During diastole, the ventricles relax, and the pressure falls to the lowest value which is referred as diastolic pressure.\nIn a healthy adult during normal resting condition systolic and diastolic blood pressure is expressed as 120mm by 80mm Hg. Blood pressure varies during conditions of physical exercise, anxiety, emotions, stress and sleep.\nA prolonged or constant elevation of blood pressure is a condition known as hypertension (High blood pressure) can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Decrease in blood pressure is termed hypotension (Low blood pressure).\nA stethoscope is used to detect the sound produced by the internal organs of human body. The heart sound is heard by placing the stethoscope on the chest. It is a useful diagnostic tool to identify and localize health problems and diagnose disease. The modern electronic stethoscopes are high previsioned instruments.\nFigure 14. 14 Stethoscope\nSphygmomanometer is a clinical instrument used to measure blood pressure when a person is in a relaxed and resting condition. The pressure of the brachial artery is measured. It helps to estimate the state of blood circulation and the working of the heart. It helps to diagnose conditions such as increased or decreased blood pressure. Manometric and modern digital types are the apparatus used to measure blood pressure.\nFigure 14. 15 Monometric (A) and Digital (B) type blood pressure apparatus\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

He identified blood groups A, B and O. AB blood group was recognized by Decastello and Steini (19 02). Human blood contains certain specific substances called agglutinogens or antigens (Ag) and agglutinins or antibodies (A b). Antigens are found on the membrane surface of RBC. Antibodies are present in blood plasma. Based on the presence or absence of antigen and antibodies human blood group is classified into four groups called, A, B, A B and O. An individual has one of the four blood groups.\n\u2018A\u2019group individuals: Antigen A is present on the surface of RBC and antibody b (anti - b) is present in the plasma.\n\u2018B\u2019group individuals: Antigen B is present on the surface of RBC and antibody a (anti - a) is present in the plasma.\n\u2018A B\u2019 group individuals: Antigens A and B are present on the surface of RBC and both the antibodies are absent in the plasma.\n\u2018O\u2019group individuals: Antigen A or B are absent on the surface of RBC. However, the plasma contains both the antibodies a and b (anti a and b).\nIn blood transfusion one must consider the antigen and antibody compatibility (matching) between the donor and the person receiving blood (recipient). When an individual receives a mismatched blood group from the donor agglutination (clumping) of blood occurs in the body which leads to death.\nPersons with \u2018A B\u2019 blood group are called \u2018Universal Recipient\u2019 as they can receive blood from persons with any blood group.\nPersons with \u2018O\u2019 blood group are called \u2018Universal Donor\u2019 as they can donate blood to persons with any blood group.\nRh factor was discovered by Landsteiner and Wiener in 1940 in Rhesus monkey. The surface of RBC contains the antigen for Rh factor. Rh + ( positive) persons have Rh antigen on the surface of RBC while, Rh - (negative)persons do not have Rh antigen on the surface of RBC. Antibodies developed against this Rh antigen is called Rh antibodies.\nTable 14. 2 Distribution of Antigen (RBC) and Antibody (Plasma) in different Blood Groups\nAntigens on RBC\nAntibodies in Plasma\nCan donate to\nCan receive from\nAntigen A and B\nNo antibody\nA, B, A B and O (Universal Recipient)\nBoth anti a and b\nA, B, A B and O(Universal Donor)\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Lymph is the fluid that flows through the lymphatic system.\nThe lymphatic capillaries unite to form large lymphatic vessels. Lymph nodes are small oval or pear - shaped structures located along the length of lymphatic vessels.\nFigure 14. 16 Lymphatic System in Man\nLymph from the intercellular spaces drains into lymphatic capillaries. Lymph is a colourless fluid formed when plasma, proteins and blood cells escape into intercellular spaces in the tissues through the pores present in the walls of capillaries. It is similar to blood plasma but is colourless and contains less proteins. The lymph contains very small amount of nutrients, oxygen, C O2, water and WBC.\nFunctions of Lymph\nSupplies nutrients and oxygen to those parts where blood cannot reach\nIt drains away excess tissue fluid and metabolites and returns proteins to the blood from tissue spaces.\nThe lymph also carries absorbed fats from small intestine to the blood. The lymphatic capillaries of intestinal villi (lacteals) absorb digested fats.\nLymphocytes in the lymph defend the body from infections.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

It is formed of three distinct components namely the neurons, neuroglia and nerve fibres.\nNeuron or nerve cell: A neuron or nerve cell is the structural and functional unit of the nervous system. It is the longest cell of the human body with a length of over 100 mew m. These cells are highly specialised to detect, receive and transmit different kinds of stimuli. Information is conducted through neurons in the form of electrical impulses from one part of the body to another.\nNeuroglia: Neuroglia are also called as glial cells. They are non - exciting, supporting cell of the nervous system. They do not initiate or conduct nerve impulses.\nNerve fibres: The nerve fibres are the long slender processes of neurons. A number of nerve fibres are bundled up together to form nerves.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

It has a central nucleus with abundant cytoplasm called neoplasm. The cytoplasm has large granular body called Nissl\u2019s granules and the other cell organelles like mitochondria, ribosomes, lysosomes, and endoplasmic reticulum. Neurons do not have the ability to divide. Several neurofibrils are present in the cytoplasm that help in transmission of nerve impulses to and from the cell body.\nDendrites: These are the numerous branched cytoplasmic processes that project from the surface of the cell body. They conduct nerve impulses towards the cyton. The branched projections increase the surface area for receiving the signals from other nerve cells.\nAxon: The axon is a single, elongated, slender projection. The end of axon terminates as fine branches which terminate into knob like swellings called synaptic knob. The plasma membrane of axon is called axolemma, while the cytoplasm is called axoplasm. It carries impulses away from the cyton. The axons may be covered by a protective sheath called myelin sheath which is further covered by a layer of Schwann cells called neurilemma. Myelin sheath breaks at intervals by depressions called Nodes of Ranvier. The region between the nodes is called as internode. Myelin sheath acts as insulator and ensures rapid transmission of nerve impulses.\nSynapse: A junction between synaptic knob of axon of one neuron and dendron of next neuron is called synaptic junction. Information from one neuron can pass to another neuron through these junctions with the release of chemicals known as neurotransmitters from the synaptic knob.\nCreate a model of a neuron using clay or beads.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Information from the receptors is transmitted as electrical impulse and is received by the dendritic tips of the neuron. This impulse travels from the dendrite to the cell body and then along the axon to its terminal end. On reaching the axonal end, it causes the nerve endings to release a chemical (neurotransmitter) which diffuses across a synapse and starts a similar electrical impulse in the dendrites of the next neuron, then to their cell body to be carried along the axon.\nIn this way, the electrical signal reaches the brain or spinal cord. The response from brain (or spinal cord) is similarly passed on to the effector organs such as the muscle or gland cell, that undergoes the desired response.\nThe flow of nerve impulses from axonal end of one neuron to dendrite of another neuron through a synapse is called synaptic transmission.\nDo You Know?\nEach neuron can transmit 1, 000 nerve impulses per second and make as many as ten thousand of synaptic contacts with other neurons.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

We the human beings differ from other animals in our ability to think and take actions, which is due to the well - developed nervous system. Human nervous system is differentiated into central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system (PN S) and autonomic nervous system (A N S).\nThe CNS acts as centre for information processing and control. It consists of the brain and the spinal cord. The PN S is made up of the nerves which connect the brain and spinal cord to all parts of the body. The A N S is formed of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

CNS is formed of two types of matter such as white matter or grey matter with respect to the presence or absence of myelin sheath which we have discussed earlier.\nFigure 15. 4 Meninges of brain\nThe brain is the controlling centre of all the body activities. It is covered by three connectives\ntissue membrane or meninges:\nDurometer(dura: tough; mater: membrane) is the outermost thick fibrous membrane\nArachnoid membrane(arachnoid: spider) is the middle, thin vascular membrane providing web like cushion\nPiamater(Pia: soft or tender) is the innermost, thin delicate membrane richly supplied with blood.\nMeningeal membranes protect the brain from mechanical injury.\nDo You Know?\nMeningitis is an inflammation of the meninges. It can occur when fluid surrounding the meninges becomes infected. The most common causes of meningitis are viral and bacterial infections.\nA human brain is formed of three main parts: (a) forebrain (b) midbrain and (c) hindbrain.\nForebrain: The forebrain is formed of cerebrum and diencephalon. The latter consists of dorsal thalamus and ventral hypothalamus.\nIt is the largest portion forming nearly two - third of the brain. The cerebrum is longitudinally divided into two halves as right and left cerebral hemispheres by a deep cleft called median cleft. Two cerebral hemispheres are interconnected by thick band of nerve fibres called corpus callosum. The outer portion of each cerebral hemisphere is formed of grey matter and is called cerebral cortex. The inner or deeper part is formed of white matter and is called cerebral medulla. The cortex is extremely folded forming elevations called gyri with depressions between them termed as sulci that increase its surface area.\nEach cerebral hemisphere is divisible into a frontal lobe, a parietal lobe, a temporal lobe and an occipital lobe. These lobes are also known as cerebral lobes and are associated with specific functions. Any damage in specific lobe intern affects its function.\nThe cerebrum is responsible for the thinking, intelligence, consciousness, memory, imagination, reasoning and willpower.\nThalamus present in cerebral medulla is a major conducting centre for sensory and motor signalling. It acts as a relay centre.\nHypothalamus\nIt lies at the base of the thalamus. It controls involuntary functions like hunger, thirst, sleep, sweating, sexual desire, anger, fear, water balance, blood pressure etc. . It acts as a thermoregulatory (temperature control) center of the body. It controls the secretion of hormones from anterior pituitary gland and is an important link between nervous system and endocrine system.\nIt is located between thalamus and hind brain. The dorsal portion of the mid brain consists of four rounded bodies called corpora quadrigemina that control visual and auditory (hearing) reflexes.\nIt is formed of three parts cerebellum, pons and medulla oblongata.\nDo You Know?\nThat human brain constitutes nearly 60 percent of fat. The most crucial molecules that determine our brain\u2019s integrity and the ability are Essential Fatty Acids (EFA s). EFA s cannot be synthesised and must be obtained from food. Fish, green leafy vegetables, almond, walnut are rich sources of EFA s.\nIt is second largest part of the brain formed of two large sized hemispheres and middle vermis. It coordinates voluntary movements and also maintains body balance.\n\u2018Pons\u2019 a Latin word meaning bridge. It is a bridge of nerve fibre that connects the lobes of cerebellum. It relays signals between the cerebellum, spinal cord, midbrain and cerebrum. It controls respiration and sleep cycle.\nMedulla Oblongata\nMedulla oblongata is the posterior most part of the brain that connects spinal cord and various parts of brain. It has cardiac centres, respiratory centres, vasomotor centres to control heartbeat, respiration and contractions of blood vessels respectively. It also regulates vomiting and salivation.\nTable 15. 1 Overview of brain functions\nCerebral cortex\nSensory perception, control of voluntaryfunctions, language, thinking, memory, decision making, creativity\nActs as relay station\nHypothalamus\nTemperature control, thirst, hunger, urination, important link between nervous system and endocrine glands\nMaintenance of posture and balance, coordinatevoluntary muscle activity\nPons andmedulla\nRole in sleep - awake cycle, cardiovascular, respiratoryand digestive control centers\nMore to Know\nElectroencephalogram (E E G) is an instrument which records the electrical impulses of brain.\nAn E E G can detect abnormalities in the brain waves and help in diagnoses of seizures, epilepsy, brain tumours, head injuries, etc. .\nSpinal Cord\nSpinal cord is a cylindrical structure lying in the neural canal of the vertebral column. It is also covered by meninges. It extends from the lower end of medulla oblongata to the first lumbar vertebra. The posterior most region of spinal cord tapers into a thin fibrous thread like structure called filum terminal.\nInternally, the spinal cord contains a cerebrospinal fluid filled cavity known as the central canal. The grey matter of spinal cord is \u2018H\u2019 shaped. The upper end of letter \u2018H\u201d forms posterior horns and lower end forms anterior horns. A bundle of fibres passes into the posterior horn forming dorsal or afferent root. Fibres pass outward from the anterior horn forming ventral or efferent root. These tworoots join to form spinal nerves. The white matter is external and have bundle of nerve tracts. Spinal cord conducts sensory and motor impulses to and from the brain. It controls reflex actions of the body.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

There are two types of reflexes.\nSimple or basic reflexes: These reflexes are inbuilt and unlearned responses. Many of the actions we perform in our day - to - day life are simple reflexes. e. g. , winking of eyes when any dust particles enter, sneezing, coughing, yawning, etc. We perform these actions without thinking.\nAcquired or conditioned reflexes: Thesereflexes are the result of practice and learning. Playing harmonium by striking a particular key on seeing a music note is an example of conditioned reflexes which required conscious training effort. Can you think of some more examples of conditioned reflexes?\nMost of the reflex actions are monitored and controlled by the spinal cord, hence also known as spinal reflexes.\nThe pathway taken by nerve impulse to accomplish reflex action is called reflex arc. Now, let us understand how the body executes reflex action when we touch a hot plate.\nWhen we touch a very hot pan, the stimulus is the heat which is sensed by receptor called as heat receptors or thermoreceptors in our hand. This stimulus (heat) intern triggers an impulse in sensory neuron.\nThe sensory neuron transmits or conveys the message to the spinal cord.\nSpinal cord interprets the stimulus, and the impulse is passed on to the relay neuron which intern transmits it to a motor neuron.\nMotor neurons carry command from spinal cord to our arm.\nMuscle in our arm contracts and we withdraw our hand immediately from the pan.\nIn this example, muscle is an effector organ which has responded to the heat. You will study in higher classes how the neuronal impulse triggers the muscular movement.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The nerves arising from the brain are called cranial nerves. Nerves arising from spinal cord are called spinal nerves.\nYou must say the colour of the word but not the name of the word.\nCranial Nerves\nIn man, there are 12 pairs of cranial nerves. Some of the cranial nerves are sensory example optic nerve which innervates the eye. Some are motor nerves which helps in rotation of eyeball. It also innervates the eye muscles, muscles of iris and tear gland.\nSpinal Nerves\nThere are 31 pairs of spinal nerves. Each spinal nerve has a dorsal sensory root and the ventral motor root. The direction of impulses in dorsal spinal root is towards the spinal cord and in ventral spinal root away from the spinal cord.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The term auxin was introduced by Kogl and Haagen - Smith (1931). Auxins are produced at the tip of stems and roots from where they migrate to the zone of elongation. Charles Darwin in 1880 observed unilateral growth and curvature of canary grass (Phalariscanariensis) coleoptiles. He came to the conclusion that some \u2018influence\u2019 was transmitted from the tip of the coleoptile to the basal region. This \u2018influence\u2019 was later identified as Auxin by Went.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

He did a series of experiments in Avena coleoptiles.\nIn his first experiment he removed the tips of Avena coleoptiles. The cut tips did not grow indicating that the tips produced something essential for growth. In his second experiment he placed the agar blocks on the decapitated coleoptile tips. The coleoptile tips did not show any response. In his next experiment he placed the detached coleoptile tips on agar blocks. After an hour, he discarded the tips and placed this agar block on the decapitated coleoptile. It grew straight up indicating that some chemical had diffused from the cut coleoptile tips into the agar block which stimulated the growth.\nFrom his experiments Went concluded that a chemical diffusing from the tip of coleoptiles was responsible for growth, and he named it as \u201cAuxin\u201d meaning \u2018to grow\u201d.\nFigure 16. 2 Went\u2019s Experiment\nTypes of Auxins: Auxins are classified into two types, namely natural auxins and synthetic auxins.\nNatural Auxins: Auxins produced by the plants are called natural auxins. Example: IAA (Indole \u2013 3 - Acetic Acid)\nSynthetic Auxins: Artificially synthesized auxins that have properties like auxins are called as synthetic auxins. Example: 2, 4 D (2, 4 Dichloro phenoxy Acetic Acid).\nPhysiological effects of auxins: Auxins bring about a variety of physiological effects in different parts of the plant body.\nAuxins promote the elongation of stems and coleoptiles which makes them to grow.\nAuxins induce root formation at low concentration and inhibit it at higher concentration.\nThe auxins produced by the apical buds suppress growth of lateral buds. This is called apical dominance.\nSeedless fruits without fertilization are induced by the external application of auxins. (Parthenocarpy). Examples: Watermelon, Grapes, Lime etc. .\nAuxins prevent the formation of abscission layer.\nDo You Know\nPhenyl Acetic Acid (P A A) and Indole 3 Acetonitrile (I A N) are natural auxins. Indole 3 Butyric Acid (I B A), Indole - 3 - Propionic Acid, \u03b1 - Naphthalene Acetic Acid (N A A), 2, 4, 5 - T (2, 4, 5 Trichloro phenoxy Acetic Acid) are some of the synthetic auxins.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Exocrine glands and endocrine glands are two kinds of glands found in animals. Endocrine glands are found in different regions of the body of animals as well as human beings. These glands are called ductless glands. Their secretions are called hormones which are produced in minute quantities. The secretions diffuse into the blood stream and are carried to the distant parts of the body. They act on specific organs which are referred as target organs.\nDo you Know\nThe branch of biology which deals with the study of the endocrine glands and its physiology is known as \u2018Endocrinology\u2019. Thomas Addison is known as Father of Endocrinology. English physiologists W. M. Bayliss and E. H. Starling introduced the term hormone in 1909. They first discovered the hormone secretin.\nExocrine glands have specific ducts to carry their secretions example. salivary glands, mammary glands, sweat glands.\nEndocrine glands present in human and other vertebrates are\nPituitary gland\nThyroid gland\nParathyroid gland\nPancreas (Islets of Langerhans)\nAdrenal gland (Adrenal cortex and Adrenal medulla)\nGonads (Testes and Ovary)\nThymus gland\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The pituitary gland is anatomically composed of two lobes and perform different functions. They are the anterior lobe (adenohypophysis) and the posterior lobe (neurohypophysis). The intermediate lobe is non - existent in humans.\nFigure 16. 7 Pituitary Gland\nThe pituitary gland forms the major endocrine gland in most vertebrates. It regulates and controls other endocrine glands and so is called as the \u201cMaster gland\u201d.\nHormones secreted by the anterior lobe (Adenohypophysis) of pituitary\nThe anterior pituitary is composed of different types of cells and secrete hormones which stimulates the production of hormones by other endocrine glands. The hormones secreted by anterior pituitary are\nGrowth Hormone\nThyroid stimulating Hormone\nAdrenocorticotropic Hormone\nGonadotropic Hormone which comprises the Follicle Stimulating Hormone and Luteinizing Hormone\nGrowth hormone (GH)\nGH promotes the development and enlargement of all tissues of the body. It stimulates the growth of muscles, cartilage and long bones. It controls the cell metabolism.\nThe improper secretion of this hormone leads to the following conditions.\nDwarfism: It is caused by decreased secretion of growth hormone in children. The characteristic features are stunted growth, delayed skeletal formation and mental disability.\nGigantism: Over secretion of growth hormone leads to gigantism in children. It is characterised by overgrowth of all body tissues and organs. Individuals attain abnormal increase in height.\nAcromegaly: Excess secretion of growth hormone in adults may lead to abnormal enlargement of head, face, hands and feet.\n2 Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)\nTSH controls the growth of thyroid gland, coordinates its activities and hormone secretion.\n3 Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)\nACTH stimulates adrenal cortex of the adrenal gland for the production of its hormones. It also influences protein synthesis in the adrenal cortex.\n4 Gonadotropic hormones (GTH)\nThe gonadotropic hormones are follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone which are essential for the normal development of gonads.\n5 Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)\nIn male, it stimulates the germinal epithelium of testes for formation of sperms. In female it initiates the growth of ovarian follicles and its development in ovary.\nLuteinizing hormone (LH)\nIn male, it promotes the Leydig cells of the testes to secrete male sex hormone testosterone. In female, it causes ovulation (rupture of mature graafian follicle), responsible for the development of corpus luteum and production of female sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone.\n6 Prolactin (PRL)\nPRL is also called lactogenic hormone. This hormone initiates development of mammary glands during pregnancy and stimulates the production of milk after childbirth.\nMore to Know\nMelatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland. It is known as a \u2018time messenger\u2019. It signals nighttime information throughout the body. Exposure to light at night, especially short - wavelength light, can decrease melatonin production interrupting sleep. Suppression of melatonin has been implicated in sleep disturbances and related metabolic disorders.\nHormones secreted by the posterior lobe (Neurohypophysis) of pituitary\nThe hormones secreted by the posterior pituitary are\nVasopressin or Antidiuretic hormone\n1 Vasopressin or Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)\nIn kidney tubules it increases reabsorption of water. It reduces loss of water through urine and hence the name antidiuretic hormone. Deficiency of ADH reduces reabsorption of water and causes an increase in urine output (polyuria). This deficiency disorder is called Diabetes insipidus.\nIt helps in the contraction of the smooth muscles of uterus at the time of childbirth and milk ejection from the mammary gland after childbirth.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The two lobes are connected by means of a narrow band of tissue known as the isthmus. This gland is composed of glandular follicles and lined by cuboidal epithelium. The follicles are filled with colloid material called thyroglobulin.\nFigure16. 8ThyroidGland\nAn amino acid tyrosine and iodine are involved in the formation of thyroid hormone. The hormones secreted by the thyroid gland are\nTriiodothyronine (T3)\nTetraiodothyronine or Thyroxine (T4)\nFunctions of thyroid hormones\nThe functions of thyroid hormones are\nProduction of energy by maintaining the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) of the body.\nHelps to maintain normal body temperature.\nInfluences the activity of central nervous system.\nControls growth of the body and bone formation.\nEssential for normal physical, mental and personality development.\nIt is also known as personality hormone.\nRegulates cell metabolism.\nMore to Know\nEdward C. Kendal in 1914 first crystallised thyroxine hormone. Charles Harrington and George Barger identified the molecular structure of thyroxine in 1927. Thyroid gland requires \u201c120 \u03bcg\u201d of iodine every day for the production of thyroxine.\nThyroid Dysfunction\nWhen the thyroid gland fails to secrete the normal level of hormones, the condition is called thyroid dysfunction. It leads to the following conditions\nHypothyroidism\nIt is caused due to the decreased secretion of the thyroid hormones. The abnormal conditions are simple goitre, cretinism and myxoedema.\nIt is caused due to the inadequate supply of iodine in our diet. This is commonly prevalent in Himalayan regions due to low level of iodine content in the soil. It leads to the enlargement of thyroid gland which protrudes as a marked swelling in the neck and is called as goitre.\nIt is caused due to decreased secretion of the thyroid hormones in children. The conditions are stunted growth, mental defect, lack of skeletal development and deformed bones. They are called as cretins.\nIt is caused by deficiency of thyroid hormones in adults. They are mentally sluggish, increase in body weight, puffiness of the face and hand, oedematous appearance.\nHyperthyroidism\nIt is caused due to the excess secretion of the thyroid hormones which leads to Grave\u2019s disease. The symptoms are protrusion of the eyeballs (Exophthalmia), increased metabolic rate, high body temperature, profuse sweating, loss of body weight and nervousness.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

They are also called supra renal glands.\nThe outer part is the adrenal cortex, and the inner part is the adrenal medulla. The two distinct parts are structurally and functionally different.\nFigure 16. 11 Adrenal Gland\nAdrenal Cortex\nThe adrenal cortex consists of three layers of cells. They are zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata and zona reticularis\nHormones of Adrenal Cortex\nThe hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex are corticosteroids. They are classified into\nGlucocorticoids\nMineralocorticoids\nFunctions of adrenocortical hormones\nGlucocorticoids\nThe glucocorticoids secreted by the zona fasciculata are cortisol and corticosterone\nThey regulate cell metabolism.\nIt stimulates the formation of glucose from glycogen in the liver.\nIt is an anti - inflammatory and anti - allergic agent.\nMineralocorticoids\nThe mineralocorticoids secreted by zona glomerulosa is aldosterone\nIt helps to reabsorb sodium ions from the renal tubules.\nIt causes increased excretion of potassium ions.\nIt regulates electrolyte balance, body fluid volume, osmotic pressure and blood pressure.\nMore to Know\nThe cortisol hormones of adrenal cortex serve to maintain the body in living condition and recover it from the severe effects of stress reactions. Thus, an increased output of cortisol is \u201clifesaving\u201d in \u201cshock conditions\u201d. It is also known as life - saving hormone.\nAdrenal Medulla\nThe adrenal medulla is composed of chromaffin cells. They are richly supplied with sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves.\nHormones of Adrenal Medulla\nIt secretes two hormones namely\nEpinephrine (Adrenaline)\nNorepinephrine (Noradrenaline)\nThey are together called as \u201cEmergency hormones\u201d. It is produced during conditions of stress and emotion. Hence it is also referred as \u201cflight, fright and fight hormone\u201d.\nFunctions of adrenal medullary hormones\nEpinephrine (Adrenaline)\nIt promotes the conversion of glycogen to glucose in liver and muscles.\nIt increases heartbeat and blood pressure.\nIt increases the rate of respiration by dilation of bronchi and trachea.\nIt causes dilation of the pupil in eye.\nIt decreases blood flow through the skin.\nNorepinephrine (Noradrenalin)\nMost of its actions are similar to those of epinephrine.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The vegetative part of plant (root, stem, leaf or bud) gets detached from the parent body and grows into an independent daughter plant. It has only mitotic division, no gametic fusion and daughter plants are\ngenetically similar to the parent plant. Vegetative reproduction may take place through\nLeaves: In Bryophyllum, small plants grow at the leaf notches\nFigure 17. 1 Vegetative reproduction by leaf\nStems: In strawberry aerial weak stems touch the ground and give off adventitious roots and buds. When the connections with the parent plant is broken, the offspring becomes independent.\nFigure 17. 2 Vegetative reproduction by stem\nRoot: Tuberous roots (Asparagus and Sweet potato) can be used for vegetative propagation.\nBulbils: In some plants the flower bud modifies into globose bulb which are called as bulbils, when these falls on the ground they grow into new plants. Example Agave.\nOther types of Vegetative Reproduction\nFragmentation: In filamentous algae, breaking of the filament into many fragments is called fragmentation. Each fragment having at least one cell, may give rise to a new filament of the algae by cell division example Spirogyra.\nFigure 17. 3 Fragmentation in Spirogyra\nFission: In thistype the parent cell divides into two daughter cells and each cell develops into a new adult organism example Amoeba.\nFigure 17. 4 Fission in Amoeba\nBudding: Formation of a daughter individual from a small projection, the bud, arising on the parent body is called budding. Example Yeast.\nFigure 17. 5 Budding in Yeast\nRegeneration: The ability of the lost body parts of an individual organism to give rise to a whole new organism is called regeneration. It takes place by specialized mass of cells example Hydra and Planaria.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

It involves only mitotic cell divisions and meiosis does not occur. Offspring produced by asexual reproduction are not only identical to parents but are also exact copies of their parent.\nAsexual reproduction occurs by spore formation. This is the most common method of asexual reproduction in fungi and bacteria.\nDuring spore formation a structure called sporangium develops from the fungal hypha. The nucleus divides several \u00d7 within the sporangium and each nucleus with small amount of cytoplasm develops into a spore. The spores are liberated, and they develop into new hypha after reaching the ground or substratum.\nFigure 17. 6 Spore formation in Rhizopus\nWet a slice of bread, and keep it in a cool, moist and dark place.\nObserve the surface of the slice with a magnifying glass.\nRecord your observations for a week.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

In such cases both sexes, male and female sex organs are needed to produce gametes. You have already learnt that the flower is a reproductive organ of a flowering plant. To understand this further we need to study the structure of a flower.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

A flower consists of four whorls borne on a thalamus. These whorls are from outside\nCalyx \u2013 consisting of sepals\nCorolla \u2013 consisting of petals\nAndroecium \u2013 consisting of stamens\nGynoecium or pistil \u2013 consisting of carpels\nFigure 17. 7 Parts of a flower\nTake a shoe flower from a growing plant.\nObserve the floral parts Calyx, Corolla, Androecium and Gynoecium.\nSeparate the stamens and carpels and observe the parts.\nDust the pollen grains on a slide and observe under a microscope.\nThe two outermost whorls calyx and corolla are non - essential or accessory whorls as they do not directly take part in the reproduction. The other two whorls androecium and gynoecium are known as the essential whorls, because both take part directly in reproduction.\nAndroecium: Androecium, the male part of flower is composed of stamens. Each stamen consists of a stalk called the filament and a small bag like structure called anther at the tip. The pollen grains are produced in the anther within the pollen sac.\nPollen grain: Pollen grains are usually spherical in shape. It has two layered walls. The hard - outer layer is known as exine. It has prominent apertures called germ pore. The inner thin layer is known as intine. It is a thin and continuous layer made up of cellulose and pectin. Mature pollen grains contain two cells, the vegetative and the generative cell. Vegetative cell contains a large nucleus. The generative cell divides mitotically to form two male gametes.\nGynoecium: Gynoecium is the female part of the flower and is made up of carpels. It has three parts:\nThe ovary contains the ovules.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of same flower or another flower borne on the same plant is known as self - pollination. Example Hibiscus.\nAdvantages of self - pollination\nSelf - pollination is possible in certain bisexual flowers.\nFlowers do not depend on agents for pollination.\nThere is no wastage of pollen grains.\nDisadvantages of self - pollination\nThe seeds are less in numbers.\nThe endosperm is minute. Therefore, the seeds produce weak plants.\nNew varieties of plants cannot be produced\nCross pollination\nCross - pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anthers of a flower to the stigma of a flower on another plant of the same species e. g. , apples, grapes, plum, etc.\nAdvantages of cross pollination\nThe seeds produced as a result of cross pollination, develop and germinate properly and grow into better plants, that is, cross pollination leads to the production of new varieties.\nMore viable seeds are produced.\nDisadvantages of cross - pollination\nPollination may fail due to distance barrier.\nMore wastage of pollen grains\nIt may introduce some unwanted characters\nFlowers depend on the external agencies for pollination\nObserve the flowers in a garden. Identify the insects and birds that act as pollinating agents.\nMaintain a record of pollinating agents and the plants.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

This takes place through the agency of animals, insects, wind and water.\nPollination by wind\nThe pollination with the help of wind is called anemophily. The anemophilous flowers produce enormous amount of pollen grains. The pollen grains are small, smooth, dry and light in weight. Pollen of such plants are blown off at a distance of more than 1, 000 km. The stigmas are comparatively large, protruding and some \u00d7 hairy to trap the pollen grains. Example Grasses and some cacti.\nPollination by insects\nPollination with the help of insects like honeybees, flies are called entomophily. To attract insects these flowers are brightly coloured, have smell and nectar. The pollen grains are larger in size, the exine is pitted, spiny etc. . so they can be adhered firmly on the sticky stigma. Approximately, 80% of the pollination done by the insects is carried by honeybees.\nPollination by water\nThe pollination with the help of water is called hydrophily. This takes place in aquatic plants.\nPollen grains are produced in large numbers.\nPollen grains float on surface of water till they land on the stigma of female flowers example Hydrilla, Vallisneria.\nFigure 17. 11 Hydrophily\nPollination by Animals\nWhen pollination takes place with the help of animals, it is called Zoophily. Flowers of such plants attract animals by their bright colour, size, scent etc. example. sun bird pollinates flowers of Canna, Gladioli etc. . Squirrels pollinate flowers of silk cotton tree.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The contents of the pollen grain move into the tube.\nPollen tube grows through the tissues of the stigma and style and finally reaches the ovule through the micropyle.\nVegetative cell degenerates and the generative cell divides to form two sperms (or male gametes).\nTip of pollen tube bursts and the two sperms enter the embryo sac.\nOne sperm fuse with the egg (syngamy) and forms a diploid zygote. The other sperm fuses with the secondary nucleus (Triple fusion) to form the primary endosperm nucleus which is triploid in nature. Since two types of fusion syngamy and triple fusion take place in an embryo sac the process is termed as double fertilization.\nAfter triple fusion, primary endosperm nucleus develops into an endosperm.\nEndosperm provides food to the developing embryo.\nLater the synergids and antipodal cells degenerate.\nSignificance of Fertilization\nIt stimulates the ovary to develop into fruit.\nIt helps in development of new characters from two different individuals.\nPost fertilization changes:\nThe ovule develops into a seed.\nThe in teguments of the ovule develop into the seed coat.\nThe ovary enlarges and develops into a fruit.\nThe seed contains the future plant or embryo which develops into a seedling under appropriate conditions.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Now we shall study the various cells which are present in the testes.\nEach testis is covered with a layer of fibrous tissue called tunica albuginea. Many septa from this layer divide the testes into pyramidal lobules, in which lie seminiferous tubules, cells of Sertoli, and the Leydig cells (interstitial cells).\nThe process of spermatogenesis takes place in the seminiferous tubules. The Sertoli cells are the supporting cells and provide nutrients to the developing sperms. The Leydig cells are polyhedral in shape and lie between the seminiferous tubules and secrete testosterone.

Female Reproductive Organ - Structure of Ovary\n\nContent:\nThe ovaries are located on either side of the lower abdomen composed of two almond shaped bodies, each lying near the lateral end of fallopian tube. Each ovary is a compact structure consisting of an outer cortex and an inner medulla. The cortex is composed of a network of connective tissue called as stroma and is lined by the germinal epithelium. The epithelial cells called the granulosa cells surround each ovum in the ovary together forming the primary follicle. As the egg grows larger, the follicle also enlarges and gets filled with the fluid and is called the Graafian follicle.\nThe number of primordial follicles in newborn female child ranges over 7 million and during reproductive period (at puberty) the number is around 60, 000 to 70, 000. During a woman\u2019s lifetime, she will only ovulate 300 to 400 of the 1 - 2 million eggs, she was initially born with. On the other side, men will produce over 500 billion sperms in their lifetime.\nFigure 17. 14 Cross section of human ovary\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The ovum is almost free of yolk. It contains abundant cytoplasm and the nucleus. The ovum is surrounded by three membranes. The plasma membrane is surrounded by inner thin zona pellucida and an outer thick corona radiata. The corona radiata is formed of follicle cells. The membrane forming the surface layer of the ovum is called vitelline membrane. The fluid - filled space between zona pellucida and the surface of the egg is called perivitelline space.\nThe reproductive system in both males and females becomes functional and an increase in sex hormone production resulting in puberty. This phenomenon tends to start earlier in females than in males. Generally, boys attain puberty between the age of 13 to 14 years, while girls reach puberty between 11 to 13 years. In male, the onset of puberty is triggered by the secretion of the hormone testosterone in the testes, in female the secretion of estrogens and progesterone from the ovary.

In human females the menstrual cycle starts at the age of 11 - 13 years which marks the onset of puberty and is called menarche and ceases around 48 - 50 years of age and this stage is termed menopause. The reproductive period is marked by characteristic events repeated almost every month in physiologically normal women (28 days with minor variation) in the form of a menstrual flow. The menstrual cycle consists of 4 phases\nMenstrual or Destructive Phase\nFollicular or Proliferative Phase\nOvulatory Phase\nLuteal or Secretory Phase\nFigure 17. 17 Menstrual cycle\nThese phases show simultaneous synchrony of events in both ovary and uterus. Changes in the ovary and the uterus are induced by the pituitary hormones (LH and FSH) and ovarian hormones (estrogen and progesterone).\nTable 17. 1 Events of Menstrual Cycle and the Role of Hormones\nChanges in Ovary\nChanges in Uterus\nHormonal Changes\nDevelopment of\nprimary follicles\nBreakdown of uterine\nendometrial lining leads to\nDecrease in\nprogesterone and\nPrimary follicles grow\nto become a fully\nmature Graafian follicle\nEndometrium regenerates\nthrough proliferation\nFSH and oestrogen\nThe Graafian follicle\nruptures, and releases\nthe ovum(egg)\nIncrease in endometrial\nEmptied Graafian\nfollicle develops into\ncorpus luteum\nEndometrium is prepared for\nimplantation if fertilization of\negg takes place, if fertilization\ndoes not occur, corpus luteum\ndegenerates, uterine wall\nruptures, bleeding starts and\nunfertilized egg is expelled\ndecrease, Corpusluteum produces progesterone and\nits level increases\nfollowed by a\ndecline, if menstrual\nbleeding occurs\nMenstruation is a periodical phenomenon that continues from puberty to menopause.

It takes place usually in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. An oocyte is alive for about 24 hours after it is released from the follicle. Fertilisation must take place within 24 hours. The sperm enters into the ovum and fuses with it, resulting in the formation of a \u2018zygote\u2019. This process is called fertilization. The zygote is a fertilized ovum.\nCleavage and Formation of Blastula\nThe first cleavage takes place about 30 hours after fertilization. Cleavage is a series of rapid mitotic divisions of the zygote to form many celledblastula (Blastocyst) which comprises an outer layer of smaller cells and inner mass of larger cells.\nImplantation\nThe blastocyst (fertilized egg) reaches the uterus and gets implanted in the uterus. The process of attachment of the blastocyst to the uterine wall (endometrium) is called implantation. The fertilized egg becomes implanted in about 6 to 7 days after fertilization.\nGastrulation\nThe transformation of blastula into gastrula and the formation of primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm) by rearrangement of the cells is called gastrulation. This takes place after the process of implantation.\nNormally one egg matures in the ovary each month. Ovulation is the rupture of the follicle releasing the egg orovum. The uterus prepares itself to receive the fertilized egg every month. The uterine lining becomes thick and spongy for implantation of the fertilized egg.\nEvents leading to when fertilization occurs and does not occur\nIf fertilization takes place the corpus luteum persists, continues to secrete progesterone maintains the thickened state of uterine wall and prevents maturation of another follicle till the end of pregnancy.\nIf fertilization does not occur, corpus luteum degenerates, the egg disintegrates and the uterine lining slowly breaks, discharged as blood and mucus leading to menstrual events.\nFigure 17. 18 Developmental stages of zygote from cleavage to blastocyst formation\nOrganogenesis\nThe establishment of the germ layers namely ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm initiate the final phase of embryonic development. During organogenesis the various organs of the foetus are established from the different germ layers attaining a functional state.\nFormation of Placenta\nThe placenta is a disc shaped structure attached to the uterine wall and is a temporary association between the developing embryo and maternal tissues. It allows the exchange of food materials, diffusion of oxygen, excretion of nitrogenous wastes and elimination of carbon dioxide. A cord containing blood vessels that connects the placenta with the foetus is called the umbilical cord.\nPregnancy (Gestation)\nIt is the time period during which the embryo attains its development in the uterus. Normally gestation period of human last for about 280 days. During pregnancy the uterus expands up to 500 \u00d7 of its normal size.\nParturition (Childbirth)\nParturition is the expulsion of young one from the mother\u2019s uterus at the end of gestation. Oxytocin from the posterior pituitary stimulates the uterine contractions and provides force to expel the baby from the uterus, causing birth.\nDo You Know\nSome \u00d7 ovaries release two eggs and each is fertilised by a different sperm, resulting in Non - Identical Twins (Fraternal Twins). If single egg is fertilised and then divides into two foetus, Identical Twins develop.\nThe process of milk production after childbirth from mammary glands of the mother is called lactation. The first fluid which is released from the mammary gland after childbirth is called as colostrum. Milk production from alveoli of mammary glands is stimulated by prolactin secreted from the anterior pituitary. The ejection of milk is stimulated by posterior pituitary hormone oxytocin.\nThe milk produced from the breast during the first 2 to 3 days after childbirth is called colostrum. It contains immune substances and provides immunity to the newborn which is essential for the body.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Contraception\n\nContent:\nContraception is one of the best birth control measures. A number of techniques or methods have been developed to prevent pregnancies in women. The devices used for contraception are called contraceptive devices. Common contraceptive methods used to prevent pregnancy are discussed here.\nBarrier methods\nHormonal methods\nIntra - Uterine Devices (IUD s)\nSurgical methods\nBarrier Methods\nThis method prevents sperms from meeting the ovum. Its entry into the female reproductive tract is prevented by barrier.\nCondom: Condom prevents deposition of sperms in the vagina. Condoms are made of thin rubber or latex sheath. Condom also protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STD) like syphilis, AIDS.\nDiaphragm (Cervical cap): Vaginal diaphragm fitting into the vagina or a cervical cap fitting over the cervix. This prevents the entry of sperms into the uterus.\nHormonal Methods\nHormonal preparations are in the form of pills or tablets (contraceptive pills). These hormones stop (interfere with ovulation) the release of egg from the ovary.\nIntra - Uterine Devices (IUD s)\nThe intrauterine device (IUD) are contraceptive devices inserted into the uterus. There are two synthetic devices commonly used in India are\nLippe\u2019s Loop and Copper - T made of copper and plastic (non - irritant). This can remain for a period of 3 years. This reduces the sperm fertilizing capacity and prevents implantation. This also helps to give adequate time interval between pregnancies.\nFigure 17. 19 Copper - T\nSurgical Methods\nSurgical contraception or sterilization techniques are terminal methods to prevent any pregnancy. This procedure in males is vasectomy (ligation of vas deferens) and in females it is tubectomy (ligation of fallopian tube). These are methods of permanent birth control.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

His experiments are the foundation for modern genetics. He was born in 1822 to a family of farmers in Silesian of Czechoslovakia. After finishing his high school at the age of 18, he entered the Augustinian Monastery at Brunn as a priest. From there he went to the University of Vienna for training in physics, mathematics and natural science. Mendel returned to the monastery in 1854 and continued to work as a priest and teach in high school. In his leisure time he started his famous experiments on the garden pea plant. He conducted his experiments in the monastery for about seven years from 1856 to 1863. He had worked on nearly 10000 pea plants of 34 different varieties. Mendel noted that they differ from one another in many ways.\nThus, Mendel had chosen 7 pairs of contrasting characters for his study as shown in the table.\nTable 18. 1 contrasting characters of pea plant used by Mendel\nStem length\nDominant character\nStem length\nRecessive character\nFlower position\nDominant character\nFlower position\nRecessive character\nFlower colour\nDominant character\nFlower color\nRecessive character\nDominant character\nRecessive character\nConstricted\nDominant character\nRecessive character\nDominant character\nRecessive character\nSeed colour\nDominant character\nRecessive character\nReasons for Mendel\u2019s success\nHe chose the pea plant as it was advantageous for experimental work in many aspects\nIt is naturally self - pollinating and so is very easy to raise pure breeding individuals.\nIt has a short life span as it is an annual and so it was possible to follow several generations.\nIt is easy to cross - pollinate.\nIt has deeply defined contrasting characters.\nThe flowers are bisexual.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

For example, it is a cross between two forms of a single trait like a cross between tall and dwarf plant.\nMendel\u2019s Explanation of Monohybrid Cross\nParental generation: Pure breeding tall plant and a pure breeding dwarf plant.\nF1 generation: Plants raised from the seeds of pure breeding parental cross in F1 generation were tall and monohybrids.\nF2 generation: Selling of the F1 monohybrids resulted in tall and dwarf plants respectively in the ratio of 3 is to1. The actual number of tall and dwarf plants obtained by Mendel was 787 tall and 277 dwarf. External expression of a particular trait is known as phenotype. So, the phenotypic ratio is 3 is to1.\nIn the F2 generation 3 different types were obtained:\nTall Homozygous \u2013 T T (Pure) \u2013 1\nTall Heterozygous \u2013 T t \u2013 2\nDwarf Homozygous \u2013 t t \u2013 1\nSo, the genotypic ratio 1 is to 2 is to1. A genotype is the genetic expression of an organism\nMendel\u2019s Interpretation on Monohybrid cross\nBased on these observations it was confirmed by Mendel that \u2018factors\u2019 are passed on from one generation to another, now referred to as genes. Tallness and Dwarfness are determined by a pair of contrasting factors, tall plant possess a pair of factors (represented by capital T - taking the first letter of the dominant character) and a plant is dwarf because it possesses factors for dwarfness (represented as small t - recessive character). These factors occur\nFigure 18. 1 Monohybrid cross\nin pairs and may be alike as in pure breeding tall plants (capital TT) and dwarf plants (small tt). This is referred to as homozygous. If they are unlike (capital T small t) they are referred to as heterozygous.\nTwo factors making up a pair of contrasting characters are called alleles or allelomorphs. One member of each pair is contributed by one parent.\nWhen two factors for alternative expression of a trait are brought together by fertilization.\nThe character which expresses itself is called dominant (Tallness) condition and that which is masked is called recessive condition (dwarfness).\nThe factors are always pure and when gametes are formed, the unit factors segregate so that each gamete gets one of the two alternative factors. It means that factors for tallness(capital T) and dwarfness(small t) are separate entities and in a gamete either capital T or small t is present. When F1 hybrids are self crossed the two entities separate and then unite independently, forming tall and dwarf plants.\nPunnett square is a checkerboard form devised by a British geneticist R C Punnett for study of genetics. It is a graphical representation to calculate the probability of all possible genotypes of offsprings in a genetic cross.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The two pairs of contrasting characteristics chosen by Mendel were shape and colour of seeds: round - yellow seeds and wrinkled - green seeds.\nMendel crossed pea plants having round - yellow seeds with pea plants having wrinkled - green seeds. Mendel made the following observations:\nMendel first crossed pure breeding pea plants having round - yellow seeds with pure breeding pea plants having wrinkled - green seeds and found that only round - yellow seeds were produced in the first generation (F1). No wrinkled - green seeds were obtained in the F1 generation. From this it was concluded that round shape and yellow colour of the seeds were dominant traits over the wrinkled shape and green colour of the seeds.\nWhen the hybrids of F1 generation pea plants having round - yellow seeds were cross - bred by self - pollination, then four types of seeds having different combinations of shape and colour were obtained in second generation or F2 generation. They were round yellow, round - green, wrinkled yellow and wrinkled - green seeds.\nFigure 18. 2 Dihybrid Cross\nThe ratio of each phenotype (or appearance) of seeds in the F2 generation is 9 is to3 is to 3 is to 1. This is known as the Dihybrid ratio.\nFrom the above results it can be concluded that the factors for each character or trait remain independent and maintain their identity in the gametes. The factors are independent to each other and pass to the offsprings (through gametes).\nResults of a Dihybrid Cross:\nMendel got the following results from his dihybrid cross\nFour Types of Plants: A dihybrid cross produced four types of F2 offsprings in the ratio of 9 with two dominant traits, 3 with one dominant trait and one recessive trait, 3 with another dominant trait and another recessive trait and 1 with two recessive traits.\nNew Combination: Two new combinations of traits with round green and wrinkled yellow had appeared in the dihybrid cross (F2 generation).\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Genes are segments of DNA, which are responsible for the inheritance of a particular phenotypic character. Each gene is present at a specific position on a chromosome called its locus. During cell division, the genetic information present in the genes is passed from one generation to another.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

They are held together by the centromere. Each chromatid is made up of spirally coiled thin structure called chromonema. The chromonema has number of bead - like structures along its length which are called chromomeres. The chromosomes are made up of DNA, RNA, chromosomal proteins (histones and non - histones) and certain metallic ions. These proteins provide structural support to the chromosome.\nFigure 18. 3 Structure of chromosome\nA chromosome consists of the following regions\nPrimary constriction: The two arms of a chromosome meet at a point called primary constriction or centromere. The centromere is the region where spindle fibres attach to the chromosomes during cell division.\nSecondary constriction: Some chromosomes possess secondary constriction at any point of the chromosome. They are known as the nuclear zone or nucleolar organizer (formation of nucleolus in the nucleus).\nTelomere: The end of the chromosome is called telomere. Each extremity of the chromosome has a polarity and prevents it from joining the adjacent chromosome. It maintains and provides stability to the chromosomes.\nSatellite: Some of the chromosomes have an elongated knob - like appendage at one end of the chromosome known as satellite. The chromosomes with satellites are called as the sat - chromosomes.\nDo you Know\nTelomeres act as aging clock in every cell.\nTelomeres are protective sequences of nucleotides found in chromosomes. As a cell divides every time, they become shorter. Telomeres get too short to do their job, causing our cells to age.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

In human, each cell normally contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. Out of which 22 pairs are autosomes and the 23rd pair is the allosome or sex chromosome.\nIn the body cells of sexually reproducing organisms, the chromosomes generally occur in pairs. This condition is called diploid (2n). The gametes produced by the organisms contain a single set of chromosomes. Hence, the gametes are said to be haploid (n). Karyotype is the number, size and shape of chromosomes in the cell nucleus of an organism. Idiogram is the diagrammatic representation of karyotype of a species. It consists of all the metaphasic chromosomes arranged in homologous pairs according to decreasing length, thickness, position of centromere, shape etc. . , with the sex chromosomes placed at the end.\nFigure 18. 5 Normal human karyotype\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

It is the most important constituent of a chromosome. The most widely accepted model of DNA is the double helical structure of James Watson and Francis Crick. They proposed the three - dimensional model of DNA on the basis of X - ray diffraction studies of DNA obtained by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. In appreciation of their discoveries on the molecular structure of nucleic acids Watson, Crick and Wilkins were awarded Nobel prize for Medicine in 1962.\nChemical Composition of DNA molecule\nDNA is a large molecule consisting of millions of nucleotides. Hence, it is also called a polynucleotide. Each nucleotide consists of three components.\nA sugar molecules Deoxyribose sugar.\nA nitrogenous base.\nThere are two types of nitrogenous bases in DNA.

DNA molecule produces exact copies of its own structure during replication process. The two strands of a DNA molecule have complementary base pairs, the nucleotides of each strand provide the information needed to produce its new strand. The two resulting daughter cells contain exactly the same genetic information as the parent cell. DNA replication involves the following steps\nOrigin of replication\nThe specific points on the DNA, where the replication begins, is the site of origin of replication. The two strands open and separate at this point forming the replication fork.\nUnwinding of DNA molecule\nThe enzyme called helicase, bind to the origin of replication site. Helicase separates the two strands of the DNA. The enzyme called topoisomerase separates the double helix above the replication fork and removes the twists formed during the unwinding process. Each of the separated DNA strands function as a template.\nFormation of RNA primer\nAn RNA primer is a short segment of RNA nucleotides. The primer is synthesized by the DNA template close to the origin of replication site.\nFigure 18. 8 Replication of DNA\nSynthesis of new complementary strand from the parent strand\nAfter the formation of RNA primer, nucleotides are added with the help of an enzyme DNA polymerase and a new complementary strand of DNA is formed from each of the parent strand. The synthesis is unidirectional.\nIn one strand, the daughter strand is synthesized as a continuous strand which is called leading strand. In the other strand, short segments of DNA are synthesized. This strand is called lagging strand. The short segments of DNA are called Okazaki fragments. The fragments are joined together by the enzyme, DNA ligase.\nThe replication stops when the replication fork of the two sides meets at a site called ter - , which is situated opposite to origin of replication site\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The female gametes or the eggs formed are similar in their chromosome type (22 + XX). Therefore, human females are homogametic.\nThe male gametes or sperms produced are of two types. They are produced in equal proportions. The sperm bearing (22 + X) chromosomes and the sperm bearing (22 + Y) chromosomes. The human males are called heterogametic.\nFigure 18. 9 Sex determination in human\nIt is a chance of probability as to which category of sperm fuses with the egg. If the egg (X) is fused by the X - bearing sperm an XX individual (female) is produced. If the egg (X) is fused by the Y - bearing sperm an XY individual (male) is produced. The sperm, produced by the father, determines the sex of the child. The mother is not responsible in determining the sex of the child.\nNow let\u2019s see how the chromosomes take part in this formation. Fertilization of the egg (22 + X) with a sperm (22 + X) will produce a female child (44 + XX). while fertilization of the egg (22 + X) with a sperm (22 + Y) will give rise to a male child (44 + XY).\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Mutation is an inheritable sudden change in the genetic material (DNA) of an organism. Mutations are classified into two main types, namely chromosomal mutation and gene mutation.\nChromosomal mutation\nThe sudden change in the structure or number of chromosomes is called chromosomal mutation. This may result in\nChanges in the structure of chromosomes: Structural changes in the chromosomes usually occurs due to errors in cell division. Changes in the number and arrangement of genes takes place as a result of deletion, duplication, inversion and translocation in chromosomes.\nChanges in the number of chromosomes: They involve addition or deletion in the number of chromosomes present in a cell. This is called ploidy. There are two types of ploidies\n(a) Euploidy (b) Aneuploidy.\nEuploidy: It is the condition in which the individual bears more than the usual number of diploid (2n) chromosomes. If an individual has three haploid sets of chromosomes, the condition is called triploidy (3n). Triploid plants and animals are typically sterile. If it has four haploid sets of chromosomes, the condition is called tetraploidy (4n). Tetraploid plants are advantageous as they often result in increased fruit and flower size.\nFigure 18. 10 Euploidy\nAneuploidy: It is the loss or gain of one or more chromosomes in a set. It is of three types. Monosomy (2n - 1), Trisomy (2n + 1) and Nullisomy (2n - 2). In man, Down\u2019s syndrome is one of the commonly known aneuploid condition.\nDown\u2019s syndrome\nThis condition was first identified by a doctor named Langdon Down in1866.\nIt is a genetic condition in which there is an extra copy of chromosome 21 (Trisomy 21). It is associated with mental retardation, delayed development, behavioural problems, weak muscle tone, vision and hearing disability are some of the conditions seen in these children.\nFigure 18. 11 Aneuploidy\n2 Gene or point mutation\nGene mutation is the changes occurring in nucleotide sequence of a gene. It involves substitution, deletion, insertion or inversion of a single or more than one nitrogenous base. Gene alteration results in abnormal protein formation in an organism.\nDo you Know\nSickle cell anaemia is caused by the mutation of a single gene. Alteration in the gene brings a change in the structure of the protein part of haemoglobin molecule. Due to the change in the protein molecule, the red blood cell (RBC) that carries the haemoglobin is sickle shaped.\nPoints to Remember\nVariations are quite apparent among closely related groups of organisms.\nMendel had chosen seven pairs of distinguishing traits: flower colour, position, seed colour, shape, pod colour, pod shape, stem length.\nEvery pea plant has two \u2018factors\u2019 which are responsible for producing a particular character or trait is called allele.\nThe process of acquiring characters or traits from parents is called \u2018Heredity\u2019.\nEach human cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. Out of these 22 pairs are called autosomes and one pair is called allosomes.\nA chromosome consists of the regions: primary constriction, centromere, secondary constriction, telomere and satellite.\nBased on the position of the centromere, the chromosomes are classified as telocentric, acrocentric, sub metacentric and metacentric chromosomes.\nEach nucleotide of DNA consists of a deoxyribose sugar, a nitrogenous base and a phosphate group. Pairing is always between a purine and a pyrimidine.\nThe sperm, produced by the father, determines the sex of the child. The mother is not responsible in determining the sex of the child.\nMutation is an inheritable change in the genetic material of an organism.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The views on the origin of life have been put forth as\nSpecial creation: This idea embodies that life on Earth is a divine creation and also attributes to supernatural event at a particular time in the past. It also emphasizes that life has not changed ever since its origin.\nSpontaneous generation (Abiogenesis): According to this theory life originated spontaneously from lifeless matter. It was believed that fishes originated from mud, frogs from moist soil and insects from decaying matter.\nBiogenesis: It was speculated by Louis Pasteur (in1862) that life originates from pre - existing life. He showed that pre - sterilised flasks kept closed airtight, with killed yeast, did not give rise to any life form, while in another flask kept open to air living organisms arose from killed yeast.\nExtra - terrestrial or Cosmic origin: Some scientists still believe that life came from outer space. This states that units of life called spores (Panspermia) were transferred to different planets including earth. This is still an idea of some astronomers. Chemical Evolution of Life: This idea was developed by Oparin (in1922) and Haldane(in1929). They proposed that with the condition prevailing on earth, life arose by a series of sequential chemical reactions. The first form of life could have come from pre - existing non - living inorganic molecules which gave rise to formation of diverse organic molecules which are transformed into colloid system to produce life. The modern concept on chemical evolution regarding origin of life was accepted.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The fore limbs of mammals are homologous structures. A human hand, a front leg of a cat, flipper of a whale and a bat\u2019s wing look dissimilar and adapted for different functions. Their mode of development and basic structure of bone are similar.\nFigure 19. 1 Forelimbs of vertebrates showing homologous structure\n2 Analogous organs: The analogous organs look similar and perform similar functions but they have different origin and developmental pattern. The function of the wings of a bat, the wings of a bird and wings of an insect are similar, but their basic structures are different.\nFigure 19. 2 Analogous structure showing a bat wing, a bird wing and an insect wing\nVestigial organs: The degenerated and non - functional organs of animals are called vestigial organs. The same organs are found to be well - developed and functional, in some of the related forms. Some of the vestigial organs in man are vermiform appendix, nictitating membrane, caudal vertebra, coccyx etc.\nAtavism: The reappearance of ancestral characters in some individuals is called atavism. e. g. , Presence of rudimentary tail in new born babies, presence of thick hair on the human body.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Leonardo da Vinci is called the Father of Palaeontology. The study of fossils helps us to understand the line of evolution of many invertebrates and vertebrates. Fossil records show that the evolution has taken a gradual process from simple to complex organisms. The origin of modern birds is supported by the evidences from palaeontology.\nArchaeopteryx: Archaeopteryx is the oldest known fossil bird. It was an early bird - like form found in the Jurassic period. It is considered to be a connecting link between reptiles and birds. It had wings with feathers, like a bird. It had long tail, clawed digits and conical teeth, like a reptile.\nFigure 19. 4 Archaeopteryx - Fossil bird\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Lamarck\u2019s theory of evolution was published in \u2018Philosophic Zoologies\u2019 in the year 1809. It is popularly known as \u2018Theory of inheritance of Acquired Characters\u201d or \u201cUse and Disuse theory\u201d or Lamarckism.\nPrinciples of Lamarckism\nInternal vital force\nLiving organisms or their component parts tend to increase in size continuously. This increase in size is due to the inherent ability of the organisms.\nEnvironment and new needs\nA change in the environment brings about changes in the need of the organisms. In response to the changing environment, the organisms develop certain adaptive characters. The adaptations of the organisms may be in the form of development of new parts of the body.\nUse and disuse theory\nLamarck\u2019s use and disuse theory states that if an organ is used constantly, the organ develops well and gets strengthened. When an organ is not used for a long time, it gradually degenerates. The ancestors of giraffe were provided with short neck and short forelimbs. Due to shortage of grass, they were forced to feed on leaves from trees. The continuous stretching of their neck and forelimbs resulted in the development of long neck and long forelimbs which is an example for constant use of an organ. The degenerated wing of Kiwi is an example for organ of disuse.\nFlow chart showing the postulates of Lamarckism\nEnvironmental change\nNeed for new structure\nDevelopment of new structure\nOrgans of use Organs of disuse\nInheritance of adaptive characters Degeneration of the structure\nOrigin of new species\nTheory of Inheritance of acquired characters\nWhen there is a change in the environment, the animals respond to the change. They develop adaptive structures. The characters developed by the animals during their life time, in response to the environmental changes are called acquired characters. According to Lamarck, the acquired characters are transmitted to the offspring by the process of inheritance.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

He was born in England in 1809. While studying in college through his friendship with Professor J S Henslow he was fascinated towards nature. At that time the British Admiralty planned a voyage of exploration for 5 years on a ship named H. M. S. Beagle around South America. Dr Henslow was asked to nominate a young naturalist for the voyage. Darwin was given the opportunity. During his five years (1831\u20131835) voyage he visited many parts of the world, a number of islands including the Galapagos Island and Pacific Island. Darwin made elaborate observations on nature of the land, plants and animals of the regions he visited. He further worked for a period of 20 years to develop the theory of natural selection.\nDarwin published his observations and conclusions under the name \u2018Origin of species\u2019 in 1859. The book of Darwin demonstrates the fact of evolution. It elaborates on the theory of Natural selection for evolutionary transformation,\nPrinciples of Darwinism\nOverproduction\nLiving beings have the ability to reproduce more individuals and form their own progeny. They have the capacity to multiply in a geometrical manner. This will increase reproductive potential leading to overproduction.\nStruggle for existence\nDue to over production, a geometric ratio of increase in population occurs. The space to live and food available for the organisms remain the same. This creates an intense competition among the organisms for food and space leading to struggle. The struggle for existence is of three types:\nIntraspecific struggle: Competition among the individuals of same species.\nInterspecific struggle: Competition between the organisms of different species living together.\nEnvironmental struggle: Natural conditions like extreme heat or cold, drought and floods can affect the existence of organisms\nThe occurrence of variation is a characteristic feature of all plants and animals. Small variations are important for evolution. According to Darwin favourable variations are useful to the organism and unfavourable variations are harmful or useless to the organism.\nSurvival of the fittest or Natural selection\nDuring the struggle for existence, the organisms which can overcome the challenging situation, survive and adapt to the surrounding environment. Organisms which are unable to face the challenges, are unfit to survive and disappear. The process of selection of organisms with favourable variation is called as natural selection.\nFlowchart showing the postulates of Darwinism.\nOverproduction\nStruggle for existence\nOrganisms eliminated from environment Natural selection\nSurvival of the fittest\nInheritance of acquired characters\nGradual accumulation of\nfavourable Characters\nOrigin of new species\nOrigin of species According to Darwin, new species originates by the gradual accumulation of favourable variations for a number of generations.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

This leads to differences in the phenotype of the offspring from its parents. These differences are called variation.\nVariation is the difference found among individuals of the same species and the offspring of the same parent. Variation is the raw material which plays an important role in evolution. Evolution would not be possible without variation.\nTypes of variations\nSomatic variation: These are the variations which affect the body (somatic) cells of the organisms. They are not heritable. They occur due to environmental factors.\nGerminal variation: These variations are produced in germ cells of an organism. They are inherited. They may be present in ancestors or may occur suddenly. They are classified into two types:\nContinuous variation\nDiscontinuous variation\nContinuous variation: These are small variations which occur among individuals of a population. They are also called as fluctuating variations. They occur by gradual accumulation in a population. Example skin colour, height and weight of an individual, colour of eye, etc. .\nDiscontinuous variation: These are sudden changes which occur in an organism due to mutations. They do not have any intermediate forms. These large variations are not useful for evolution.\nExample short legged Ancon sheep, six or more digits (fingers) in human, etc. .\nDiscontinuous variation forms the basis for Mutation theory proposed by De Vries.\nRelationship between Mutation and Variation\nMutation and Variation are two events involved in the process of evolution. Mutation arises due to errors occurring in DNA during replication or exposure to UV rays or chemicals. Mutation leads to variation. It brings about changes in a single individual.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

It is the branch of palaeontology that deals with recovery and identification of plant remains of geological past.\nA plant fossil is any preserved part of a plant that has died long back. Fossils may be a prehistoric impression that may be hundred to millions of years old. Majority of the plant fossils are disarticulated parts of plants. it is rare to find plants to be preserved as whole.\nImportance of fossils\nThey throw light on phylogenyand evolution of plants.\nFossil plants give a historical approach to plant kingdom.\nFossils are useful in classification of plants.\nFossil plants can be used in the field of descriptive and comparative anatomy.\nKaspar Maria Von Sternberg\nHe is the \u201cFather of Palaeobotany\u201d (1761\u2013 1838) was born in Europe.

This method of fossilization can preserve hard and soft parts. Most bones and wood fossils are petrified.\nMold and Cast\nA replica of a plant or animal is preserved in sedimentary rocks. When the organism gets buried in sediment it is dissolved by underground water leaving a hollow depression called a Mold. It shows the original shape but does not reveal the internal structure. Minerals or sediment fill the hollow depression and forms a cast.\nPreservation\nOriginal remains can be preserved in ice or amber (tree sap). They protect the organisms from decay. The entire plant or animal is preserved.\nCompression\nWhen an organism dies, the hard parts of their bodies settle at the bottom of the sea bed and are covered by sediment. The process of sedimentation goes on continuously and fossils are formed.\nInfiltration or Replacement\nThe precipitation of minerals takes place which later on infiltrate the cell wall. The process is brought about by several mineral elements such as silica, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate. Hard parts are dissolved and replaced by these minerals\nDo you Know\nLiving Fossils: These are living organisms that are similar in appearance to their fossilized distant ancestors and usually have no extinct close features. Example Ginkobiloba.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

They may be carbon, uranium, lead or potassium. It is used in palaeobotany and anthropology for determining the age of human fossils and manuscripts.\nRadioactive carbon(C14) dating method\nThis method was discovered by W. F. Libby (1956). Carbon consumption of animals and plants stops after death and since then, only the decaying process of C14 occurs continuously. The time passed since death of a plant or animal can be calculated by measuring the amount of C14. present in their body.\nMore to Know\nWhat is the Geologic Time Scale?\nThe geological time scale is a system of chronological dating that relates geological rock strata to time, and is used by geologists, palaeontologists, and other Earth scientists to describe the timing and relationships of events that have occurred during Earth\u2019s history.\nDo you Know\nThiruvakkarai fossil wood park (Villupuram district, Tamil Nadu):\n2 million years ago tree trunks that got buried along the river, in course of time the organic matter was replaced by silica and was fossilized. They retained their color, shape and texture and was converted into solid rocks. The annular rings, the texture, colors of the layers, nodes and all properties of plants are still visible.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The term Ethnobotany was coined by J. W. Hershberger in 1895 to include the study of plants used by the primitive and aboriginal people. Though this discipline has existed for ages, ethnobotany emerged as a distinct academic branch of natural science in 20th century.\nAspects of ethnobotany\nEthnobotany has relevance with problems of nutrition, health care and life support system, faith in plants, cottage industries, economic upliftment, conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of plant resources.\nImportance of Ethnobotany\nIt provides traditional uses of plant.\nIt gives information about certain unknown and known useful plants.\nThe ethnos medicinal data will serve as a useful source of information for the chemists, pharmacologists and practitioners of herbal medicine.\nTribal communities utilize ethnos medicinal plant parts like bark, stem, roots, leaves, flower bud, flowers, fruits, seeds, oils, resins, dyes, gum for the treatment of diseases like diarrhoea, fever, headache, diabetes, jaundice, snakebites, leprosy, etc. .\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

If your answer is no, then how do you detect the existence of life in space? Astrobiology or exobiology is the science which looks for the presence of extra - terrestrial life in the universe.\nAstrobiology deals with the origin, evolution and distribution of life in the universe and to investigate the possibility of life in another world.\nThe major concept in astrobiology is the habitable zone. The theory explains that any planets can support the existence of life, if it fulfils two important criteria.\nIt must have a right mass to retain an atmosphere.\nIt must have an orbit at just the right distance from its star (Sun) that it allows liquid water to exist. Thus, the distance needs to be neither too hot or not too cold and is often referred as Goldilocks Zone for life.\nIn our solar system \u2018Earth\u2019 is the only planet in the goldilocks zone. Since, this zone varies at \u00d7 as the star evolves, we know that Mars have also been habitable. The life on Mars is likely to be the creatures, we find in extreme environments on earth.\nThe organisms which live in extreme environmental conditions on earth are called extremophiles. Thus, within our own Solar System, there are many areas that are different from the Earth where it is probable to find the presence of life similar to extremophile bacteria.\nFigure 19. 5 Microbial diversity from sandstone and granite from the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica\nDo you Know\nNASA is developing the Mars 2020 astrobiology to investigate an Astro biologically relevant ancient environment on Mars, its surface geological processes and the possibility of past life on Mars and preservation of biosignatures within accessible geological materials.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The path of light is called ray of light and group of these rays are called as beam of light. Any object which gives out light are termed as source of light. Some of the sources emit their own light and they are called as luminous objects. All the stars, including the Sun, are examples for luminous objects. We all know that we are able to see objects with the help of our eyes. Butwe cannot see any object in a dark room. Can you explain why? If your answer is \u2018we need light to see objects\u2019, the next question is \u2018if you make the light from a torch to fall on your eyes, will you be able to see the objects? \u2019 Definitely, \u2018NO\u2019. We can see the objects only when the light is made to fall on the objects and the light reflected from the objects is viewed by our eyes. You would have studied about the reflection and refraction of light elaborately in your previous classes. In this chapter, we shall discuss about the scattering of light, images formed by convex and concave lenses, human eye and optical instruments such as telescopes and microscopes.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Light is a form of energy.\n2. Light always travels along a straight line.\n3. Light does not need any medium for its propagation. It can even travel through vacuum.\n4. The speed of light in vacuum or air is, c = 3 \u00d7 10 ^8metre second power \u20131.\n5. Since, light is in the form of waves, it is characterized by a wavelength (\u03bb) and a frequency (\u03bd), which are related by the following equation: c = nu into lambda(c - velocity of light).\n6. Different coloured light has different wavelength and frequency.\n7. Among the visible light, violet light has the lowest wavelength and red light has the highest wavelength.\n8. When light is incident on the interface between two media, it is partly reflected and partly refracted.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

This deviation of ray of light is called refraction. Refraction takes place due to the difference in the velocity of light in different media. The velocity of light is more in a rarer medium and less in a denser medium. Refraction of light obeys two laws of refraction.\n2. 2. 1 First law of refraction:\nThe incident ray, the refracted ray of light and the normal to the refracting surface all lie in the same plane.\n2. 2. 2 Second law of refraction:\nThe ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence and sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of refractive indices of the two media. This law is also known as Snell\u2019s law.\nsin i / sin r equal to mew2 / mew 1 2. 1\nRefractive index gives us an idea of how fast or how slow light travels in a medium. The ratio of speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in a medium is defined as refractive index mew of that medium.\nMew = c by v\nThe speed of light in a medium is low if the refractive index of the medium is high and vice versa.\nWhen light travels from a denser medium into a rarer medium, the refracted ray is bent away from the normal drawn to the interface.\nWhen light travels from a rarer medium into a denser medium, the refracted ray is bent towards the normal drawn to the interface.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

If a source of light produces a light of single colour, it is known as a monochromatic source. On the other hand, a composite source of light produces a white light which contains light of different colours. Sun light is a composite light which consists of light of various colours or wavelengths. Another example for a composite source is a mercury vapour lamp. What do you observe when a white light is refracted through a glass prism?\nWhen a beam of white light or composite light is refracted through any transparent media such as glass or water, it is split into its component colours. This phenomenon is called as \u2018dispersion of light\u2019.\nThe band of colours is termed as spectrum. This spectrum consists of following colours: Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red. These colours are represented by the acronym \u201cVIBGYOR\u201d. Why do we get the spectrum when white light is refracted by a transparent medium? This is because, different coloured lights are bent through different angles. That is the angle of refraction is different for different colours.\nAngle of refraction is the smallest for red and the highest for violet. From Snell\u2019s law, we know that the angle of refraction is determined in terms of the refractive index of the medium. Hence, the refractive index of the medium is different for different coloured lights. This indicates that the refractive index of a medium is dependent on the wavelength of the light.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Based on initial and final energy of the light beam, scattering can be classified as,\n1) Elastic scattering 2) Inelastic scattering\n1) Elastic scattering\nIf the energy of the incident beam of light and the scattered beam of light are same, then it is called as \u2018elastic scattering\u2019.\n2) Inelasticscattering\nIf the energy of the incident beam of light and the scattered beam of light are not same, then it is called as \u2018inelastic scattering\u2019. The nature and size of the scatterer results in different types of scattering. They are\nRayleigh scattering\nMie scattering\nTyndall scattering\nRaman scattering\nRayleigh scattering\nThe scattering of sunlight by the atoms or molecules of the gases in the earth\u2019s atmosphere is known as Rayleigh scattering.\nRayleigh\u2019s scattering law\nRayleigh\u2019s scattering law states that, \u201cThe amount of scattering of light is inversely proportional to the fourth ^of its wavelength\u201d. Amount of scattering \u2018S\u2019proportional 1 by lambta ^4 According to this law, the shorter wavelength colours are scattered much more than the longer wavelength colours.\nWhen sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the blue colour (shorter wavelength) is scattered to a greater extent than the red colour (longer wavelength). This scattering causes the sky to appear in blue colour.\nAt sunrise and sunset, the light rays from the Sun have to travel a larger distance in the atmosphere than at noon. Hence, most of the blue lights are scattered away and only the red light which gets least scattered reaches us. Therefore, the colour of the Sun is red at sunrise and sunset.\nMie scattering\nMie scattering takes place when the diameter of the scatterer is similar to or larger than the wavelength of the incident light. It is also an elastic scattering. The amount of scattering is independent of wavelength.\nMie scattering is caused by pollen, dust, smoke, water droplets, and other particles in the lower portion of the atmosphere.\nMie scattering is responsible for the white appearance of the clouds. When white light falls on the water drop, all the colours are equally scattered which together form the white light.\nTyndall Scattering\nWhen a beam of sunlight, enters into a dusty room through a window, then its path becomes visible to us. This is because, the tiny dust particles present in the air of the room scatter the beam of light. This is an example of Tyndall Scattering.\nThe scattering of light rays by the colloidal particles in the colloidal Solution is called Tyndall Scattering or Tyndall Effect.\nDo you Know\nColloid is a microscopically small substance that is equally dispersed throughout another material. Example: Milk, Ice cream, muddy water, smoke\nRaman scattering\nWhen a parallel beam of monochromatic (single coloured) light passes through a gas or liquid or transparent solid, a part of light rays is scattered.\nThe scattered light contains some additional frequencies (or wavelengths) other than that of incident frequency (or wavelength). This is known as Raman scattering or Raman Effect.\nRaman Scattering is defined as \u201cThe interaction of light ray with the particles of pure liquids or transparent solids, which leads to a change in wavelength or frequency. \u201d\nThe spectral lines having frequency equal to the incident ray frequency is called \u2018Rayleigh line\u2019 and the spectral lines which are having frequencies other than the incident ray frequency are called \u2018Raman lines. The lines having frequencies lower than the incident frequency is called stokes lines and the lines having frequencies higher than the incident frequency are called Anti - stokes lines.\nYou will study more about Raman Effect in higher classes.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

A beam of light passing through it, is converged to a point. So, a convex lens is also called as converging lens.\n(two) Concave or bi - concave Lens: It is a lens bounded by two spherical surfaces such that it is thinner at the centre than at the edges. A parallel beam of light passing through it, is diverged or spread out.

The position, size and nature of the image formed can be understood only if we know certain basic rules.\nRule - 1: When a ray of light strikes the convex or concave lens obliquely at its optical centre, it continues to follow its path without any deviation (Figure2. 3)\nFigure 2. 3 Rays passing through the optical centre\nRule - 2: When rays parallel to the principal axis strikes a convex or concave lens, the refracted rays are converged to (convex lens) or appear to diverge from (concave lens) the principal focus (Figure2. 4).\nFigure 2. 4 Rays passing parallel to the optic axis\nRule - 3: When a ray passing through (convex lens) or directed towards (concave lens) the principal focus strikes a convex or concave lens, the refracted ray will be parallel to the principal axis (Figure2. 5).\nFigure 2. 5 Rays passing through or directed towards the principal focus\n2. 7REFRACTION THROUGH A CONVEX LENS\n2. 7REFRACTION THROUGH A CONVEX LENS\nLet us discuss the formation of images by a convex lens when the object is placed at various positions.\nObject at infinity\nWhen an object is placed at infinity, a real image is formed at the principal focus. The size of the image is much smaller than that of the object (Figure2. 6).\nFigure 2. 6 Object at infinity\nObject placed beyond C(greater than 2F)\nFigure 2. 7 Object placed beyond C( greater than 2F)\nWhen an object is placed behind the centre of curvature (beyond C), a real and inverted image is formed between the centre of curvature and the principal focus. The size of the image is the smaller than that of the object (Figure2. 7).\nObject placed at C\nWhen an object is placed at the centre of curvature, a real and inverted image is formed at the other centre of curvature. The size of the image is the same as that of the object (Figure2. 8).\nFigure. 2. 8 Object placed at C\nObject placed between F and C\nWhen an object is placed in between the centre of curvature and principal focus, a real and inverted image is formed behind the centre of curvature.

The size of the image is much smaller than that of the object (Figure2. 12).\nFigure 2. 12 Concave Lens - Object at infinity\nObject anywhere on the principal axis at a finite distance\nWhen an object is placed at a finite distance from the lens, a virtual image is formed between optical centre and focus of the concave lens. The size of the image is smaller than that of the object (Figure2. 13).\nFigure 2. 13 Concave Lens - Object at a finite distance\nBut, as the distance between the object and the lens is decreased, the distance between the image and the lens also keeps decreasing. Further, the size of the image formed increases as the distance between the object and the lens is decreased. This is shown in (figure2. 14).\nFigure 2. 14 Concave lens - Variation in position and size of image with object distance\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Spherical lenses produce magnification and it is defined as the ratio of the height of the image to the height of an object. Magnification is denoted by the letter \u2018m\u2019. If height of the object is h and height of the image is h \u0301, the magnification produced by lens is m = height of the image / height of the object = h \u2014 by h equation 2. 3\nAlso, it is related to the distance of the object (u) and the distance of the image (v) as follows:\nM = distance of the image / distance of the object = v by u equation 2. 4\nIf the magnification is greater than 1, then we get an enlarged image.

This ability of a lens to converge (convex lens) or diverge (concave lens) is called as its power. Hence, the ^of a lens can be defined as the degree of convergence or divergence of light rays. ^of a lens is numerically defined as the reciprocal of its focal length.\np equal to one by f equation 2. 6\nThe SI unit of ^of a lens is dioptre. It is represented by the symbol D. If focal length is expressed in \u2018m\u2019, then the ^of lens is expressed in \u2018D\u2019 Thus 1D is the ^of a lens, whose focal length is 1metre. 1D = 1metre^ - 1.\nBy convention, the ^of a convex lens is taken as positive whereas the ^of a concave lens is taken, as negative.\nMore to Know\nThe lens formula and lens maker\u2019s formula are applicable to only thin lenses. In the case of thick lenses, these formulae with little modifications are used.\nTable2. 1Differences between a Convex Lens and a Concave Lens\nSerial number\nConvex Lens\nConcave Lens\nA convex lens is thicker in the middle than at edges.\nA concave lens is thinner in the middle than at edges.\nIt is a converging lens.\nIt is a diverging lens.\nIt produces mostly real images.\nIt produces virtual images.\nIt is used to treat hypermetropia.\nIt is used to treat myopia.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

They are the gateway to the wonderful world.\nStructure of the eye\nThe eye ball is approximately spherical in shape with a diameter of about 2. 3 cm. It consists of a tough membrane called sclera, which protects the internal parts of the eye. Important parts of human eye are\nCornea: This is the thin and transparent layer on the front surface of the eyeball as shown in figure 2. 15. It is the main refracting surface. When light enters through the cornea, it refracts or bends the light on to the lens.\nIris: It is the coloured part of the eye. It may be blue, brown or green in colour. Every person has a unique colour, pattern and texture. Iris controls amount of light entering into the pupil like camera aperture.\nPupil: It is the centre part of the Iris. It is the pathway for the light to retina.\nRetina: This is the back surface of the eye. It is the most sensitive part of human eye, on which real and inverted image of objects is formed.\nEye Lens \u2013It is the important part of human eye. It is convex in nature.\nCiliary muscles \u2013Eye lens is fixed between the ciliary muscles. It helps to change the focal length of the eye lens according to the position of the object.\nWorking of the eye\nThe transparent layer cornea bends the light rays through pupil located at the centre part of the Iris. The adjusted light passes through the eye lens. Eye lens is convex in nature. So, the light rays from the objects are converged and a real and inverted image is formed on retina. Then, retina passes the received real and inverted image to the brain through optical nerves. Finally, the brain senses it as erects image.\n^of Accommodation\nThe ability of the eye lens to focus nearby as well as the distant objects is called ^of accommodation of the eye. This is achieved by changing the focal length of the eye lens with the help of ciliary muscles. Eye lens is made of a flexible, jelly - like material. By relaxing and contracting the ciliary muscle, the curvature and hence the call length of the eye lens can be altered. When we see distant objects, the ciliary muscle relaxes and makes the eye lens thinner. This increases the focal length of the eye lens. Hence, the distant object can be clearly seen. On the other hand, when we look at a closer object, the focal length of the eye lens is decreased by the contraction of ciliary muscle. Thus, the image of the closer object is clearly formed on the retina.\nPersistence of vision\nIf the time interval between two consecutive light pulses is less than 1 by 16 second, human eye cannot distinguish them separately.

But, for some people, the eye loses its ^of accommodation. This could happen due to many reasons including ageing. Hence, their vision becomes defective. Let us discuss some of the common defects of human eye.\nMyopia, also known as short sightedness, occurs due to the lengthening of eye ball. With this defect, nearby objects can be seen clearly but distant objects cannot be seen clearly. The focal length of eye lens is reduced or the distance between eye lens and retina increases. Hence, the far point will not be infinity for such eyes and the far point has come closer. Due to this, the image of distant objects is formed before the retina (Figure 2. 16 - a). This defect can be corrected using a concave lens (Figure 2. 16 - b). The focal length of the concave lens to be used is computed as follows:\nLet a person with myopia eye can see up to a distance x. Suppose that he wants to see all objects farther than this distance, that is up to infinity. Then the focal length of the required concave lens is\nf = - x. If the person can see up to a distance x and he wishes to see up to a distance y, then, the focal length of the required concave lens is, x \u00d7 y by x - y equation 2. 7\nHypermetropia\nHypermetropia, also known as long sightedness, occurs due to the shortening of eye ball. With this defect, distant objects can be seen clearly but nearby objects cannot be seen clearly. The focal length of eye lens is increased or the distance between eye lens and retina decreases. Hence, the near point will not be at 25cm for such eyes and the near point has moved farther. Due to this, the image of nearby objects is formed behind the retina (Figure 2. 17 - a). This defect can be corrected using a convex lens (Figure 2. 17 - b). The focal length of the convex lens to be used is computed as follows:\nLet a person with hypermetropia eye can see object beyond a distance d. Suppose that he wants to see all objects closer than this distance up to a distance D. Then, the focal length of the required convex lens isf equal to d \u00d7 D by d - D. equation 2. 8\nDue to ageing, ciliary muscles become weak and the eye - lens become rigid (inflexible) and so the eye loses its ^of accommodation.\nBecause of this, an aged person cannot see the nearby objects clearly. So, it is also called as \u2018old age hypermetropia\u2019.\nSome persons may have both the defects of vision - myopia as well as hypermetropia. This can be corrected by \u2018bifocal lenses\u2019 in which, upper part consists of concave lens (to correct myopia) used for distant vision and the lower part consists of convex lens (to correct hypermetropia) used for reading purposes.\nAstigmatism\nIn this defect, eye cannot see parallel and horizontal lines clearly. It may be inherited or acquired. It is due to the imperfect structure of eye lens because of the development of cataract on the lens, ulceration of cornea, injury to the refracting surfaces, etc. . Astigmatism can be corrected by using cylindrical lenses.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

It is classified as\n1. Simple microscope\n2. Compound microscope\nSimple Microscope\nSimple microscope has a convex lens of short focal length. It is held near the eye to get enlarged image of small object Let an object (A B) is placed at a point within the principal focus (u less than f) of the convex lens and the observer\u2019s eye is placed just behind the lens.\nAs per this position the convex lens produces an erect, virtual and enlarged image A \u2014 b \u2014. The image formed is in the same side of the object and the distance equal to the least distance of distinct vision (D) (For normal human eye D = 25 cm).\nUses of Simple microscope\nSimple microscopes are used\na) by watch repairers and jewellers.\nb) to read small letters clearly.\nc) to observe parts of flower, insects etc.\nd) to observe finger prints in the field of forensic science.\nCompound microscope\nCompound microscope is also used to see the tiny objects. It has better magnification ^than simple microscope. Magnification ^of microscopes can be increased by decreasing the focal length of the lens used. Due to constructional limitations, the focal length of the lens cannot be decreased beyond certain limit. This problem can be solved by using two separate biconvex lenses.\nConstruction\nA compound microscope consists of two convex lenses. The lens with the shorter focal length is placed near the object, and is called as \u2018objective lens\u2019 or \u2018objective piece\u2019. The lens with larger focal length and larger aperture placed near the observer\u2019s eye is called as \u2018eye lens\u2019 or \u2018eye piece\u2019. Both the lenses are fixed in a narrow tube with adjustable provision.\nThe object (AB) is placed at a distance slightly greater than the focal length of objective lens (u > of) u greater than fo. A real, inverted and magnified image (A'B') is formed at the other side of the objective lens.\nThis image behaves as the object for the eye lens. The position of the eye lens is adjusted in such a way, that the image (A'B') A \u2014 B \u2014 falls within the principal focus of the eye piece. This eye piece forms a virtual, enlarged and erect image (A\" B\") A double \u2014 B double \u2014 on the same side of the object\nCompound microscope has 50 to 200 \u00d7 more magnification ^than simple microscope\nTravelling Microscope\nA travelling microscope is one of the best instruments for measuring very small length with high degree of accuracy at the order of 0. 01mm. It works based on the principle of vernier. Its least count is 0. 01 mm.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

With our naked eye we can\u2019t visualize the phenomena distinctly. Then, how can we see the distant object in clearer manner? It is possible with telescope.\nTelescope is an optical instrument to see the distant objects. The first telescope was invented by Johann Lippershey in 1608. Galileo made a telescope to observe distant stars. He got the idea, from a spectacle maker who one day observed that the distant weather cock appeared magnified through his lens system fitted in his shop. Galileo observed the satellites of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn through his telescope. Kepler invented Telescope in1611 which was fundamentally similar to the astronomical telescope.\nTypes of Telescopes\nAccording to optical property, it is classified into two groups:\none) refracting telescope two) reflecting telescope\nIn refracting telescope lenses are used. Galilean telescope, Keplerian telescope, Achromatic refractors, are some refracting telescopes.\nIn reflecting telescope parabolic mirrors are used Gregorian, Newtonian, Cassegrain telescope are some Reflecting telescopes According to the things which are observed, Astronomical Telescope and Terrestrial Telescopes are the two major types of telescopes.\nAstronomical Telescope\nAn astronomical telescope is used to view heavenly bodies like stars, planets galaxies and satellites.\nTerrestrial Telescopes\nThe image in an astronomical telescope is inverted. So, it is not suitable for viewing objects on the surface of the Earth. There fore, a terrestrial telescope is used. It provides an erect image. The major difference between astronomical and terrestrial telescope is erecting the final image with respect to the object.\nAdvantages of Telescopes\nElaborate view of the Galaxies, Planets, stars and other heavenly bodies is possible.\nCamera can be attached for taking photograph for the celestial objects.\nTelescope can be viewed even with the low intensity of light.\nDisadvantages\nFrequent maintenances needed.\nIt is not easily portable one.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

They are\nMass selection\nPure line selection\nClonal selection\nMass selection\nSeeds of best plants showing desired characters are collected from a mixed population. The collected seeds are allowed to raise the second generation. This process is carried out for seven or eight generations. At the end, they will be multiplied and distributed to the farmers for cultivation.\nSome common examples for mass selection are groundnut varieties like TMV\u20132 and AK\u201310. Its schematic representation is given below.\nFigure 20. 5Mass Selection\nPureline selection\nPure line is \u201cthe progeny of a single individual obtained by self - breeding\u201d. This is also called as individual plant selection. In pure line selection large numbers of plants are selected from a self - pollinated crop and harvested individually.\nIndividual plant progenies from them are evaluated separately.

It is a process by which genetic variations are created which in turn brings about changes in the organism. The organism which undergoes mutation is called a mutant.\nThe factors which induce mutations are known as mutagens or mutagenic agents. Mutagens are of two types namely physical mutagens and chemical mutagens.\nMore to know\nGamma Garden\nGamma garden or atomic garden is a concept popularised after World War II for the peaceful use of atomic energy for crop improvement. This is a type of induced mutation breeding where radioactive sources particularly gamma rays from Cobalt - 60 or Caesium - 137 are used to induce desirable mutations in crop plants.\nPhysical mutagens\nRadiations like X - rays, \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 - rays, UV rays, temperature etc. . which induce mutations are called physical mutagens\nChemical mutagens\nChemical substances that induce mutations are called chemical mutagens.\nExample Mustard gas and nitrous acid.

Hybrid is superior in one or more characters to both parents. Hybridization is the common method of creating genetic variation to get improved varieties.\nHybridization Experiment: Triticale (The first man \u2013 made cereal)\nTriticale is the first man - made cereal hybrid. It is obtained by crossing wheat (Triticum durum, 2n = 28) and rye (Secale cereal, 2n = 14). The F1 hybrid is sterile (2n = 21). Then the chromosome number is doubled using colchicine and it becomes a hexaploidy Triticale (2n = 42).\nThe cycle of crop raising and selection continues till the plants with the desired characters are finally obtained. The development of new varieties is a long - drawn process. Two main aspects of hybridization are to combine the characters of two plants in one plant and to utilize hybrid vigour.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The term recombinant is used because DNA from two different sources can be joined together. Hence, genetic engineering is also called as recombinant DNA technology.\nDo you Know\nPlasmid is the small circular double stranded DNA molecule found in the cytoplasm of bacterial cell and separated from chromosomal DNA. It can replicate independently.\nMore to Know\nRestriction enzymes recognises a specific base pair sequence (palindromic sequence) in DNA called as restriction site and cleaves the phosphodiester bond within DNA.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Example neurons or nerve cell that can transmit signals, or heart cells which contract to pump blood or pancreatic cells to secrete insulin. These specialised cells are called as differentiated cells.\nIn contrast to differentiated cells, stem cells are undifferentiated or unspecialised mass of cells. The stem cells are the cells of variable potency. Potency refers to the number of possible fates that a cell can acquire. The two important properties of stem cells that differentiate them from other cells are:\nits ability to divide and give rise to more stem cells by self - renewal\nits ability to give rise to specialised cells with specific functions by the process of differentiation.\nTypes of stem cells\nEmbryonic stem cells can be extracted and cultured from the early embryos. These cells are derived from the inner cell mass of blastocyst. These cells can be developed into any cell in the body.\nAdult stem cell or somatic stem cell are found in the neonatal (new born) and adults. They have the ability to divide and give rise to specific cell types. Sources of adult stem cells are amniotic fluid, umbilical cord and bone marrow.\nFigure 20. 8Differentiation of stem cells\nStem - cell therapy\nSome \u00d7 cells, tissues and organs in the body may be permanently damaged or lost due to genetic condition or disease or injury. In such situations stem cells are used for the treatment of diseases which is called stem - cell therapy. In treating neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease neuronal stem cells can be used to replace the damaged or lost neurons.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Did you know that the DNA pattern of two individuals cannot be same except for identical twins. Each person\u2019s DNA sequence is unique due to the small difference in the base pairs. Therefore, if we want to compare the genetic difference among the two individuals, DNA fingerprinting is the easier and quicker method. This technique was developed by Alec Jeffrey.\nThe technique analyses each individual\u2019s unique DNA sequences and provides distinctive characteristics of individual which helps in identification. Variable number of tandem repeat sequences (VNTR s) serve as molecular markers for identification.\nIn human beings, 99 % of the DNA base sequences are the same and this is called as bulk genomic DNA. The remaining 1 % DNA sequence differs from one individual to another. This 1 % DNA sequence is present as small stretch of repeated sequences which is known as satellite DNA. The number of copies of the repeat sequence also called as VNTR s differs from one individual to another, and results in variation in the size of the DNA segment.\nVNTRs illustration of three persons\nAs shown in the illustration, the sequence AGCT is repeated six \u00d7 in first person, five \u00d7 in second person and seven \u00d7 in third person. Because of this, DNA segment of third person will be larger in size followed by DNA segment of first person and then the second person. Thus, it is clear that satellite DNA bring about variation within the population. Variation in DNA banding pattern reveals differences among the individuals.\nApplications of DNA Fingerprinting\nDNA fingerprinting technique is widely used in forensic applications like crime investigation such as identifying the culprit. It is also used for paternity testing in case of disputes.\nIt also helps in the study of genetic diversity of population, evolution and speciation.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

They should be provided with proper care and attention to overcome their sufferings.\nMedical care: A child victim of sexual offences should receive medical care and treatment from health care professionals to overcome mental stress and depression.\nLegal Counsel: The family or the guardian of the child victim shall be entitled to free assistance of a legal counsel for such offence.\nRehabilitation: Enrolling in schools and resuming their education is an important step towards rehabilitation of the child. It is essential that the child\u2019s life is gradually returned to normal after the incidence of abuse.\nCommunity based efforts: Conducting awareness campaign on child abuse and its prevention.\nMore to Know\nThe National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) was set up in March 2007 under the Commissions for Protection of Child Rights (CPCR) Act, 2005. This act emphasizes the principle of universality and inviolability of child rights and recognizes the tone of urgency in all the\nchild related policies of the country.\nProtection of all children of all age group up to 18 years of age is of equal importance.

Carbohydrates should be taken in the form of starch and complex sugars. Refined sugars (sucrose and glucose) should be avoided. Diet comprising whole grains, millets (jowar, bajra, ragi), green leafy vegetables, wheat and unpolished rice should be included in diet regularly.\nCarbohydrates is maintained to about 50 to 55% of the total calories. High protein content of 10 to15% of the total intake is required to supply essential amino acids. Fat content in the diet should be 15 to 25% of the total calories. Saturated fat intake should be reduced. Polyunsaturated fatty acid content should be higher.\nManagement with insulin: Commercially available insulin preparations (short and long acting) are also used to maintain blood glucose levels.\nPhysical activity: Exercise plays an important role in facilitating a good control of diabetes, in addition to strengthening and toning up the muscles.\nEducation and Awareness: People with diabetics should be educated on the nature of disease they have and the possibility of complications of the disease, if blood sugar is not kept under control, Instructions regarding diet, exercise and drugs should be explained.\nFlax seeds containing insoluble fibre, Guavas, Tomatoes and Spinach are foods which help reduce blood sugar levels.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Obesity is a complex multifactorial chronic disease developing from influence of social, behavioural, psychological, metabolic and cellular factors.\nObesity occurs if intake of calories is more than the expenditure of energy. Over weight and obesity are conditions where the body weight is greater than the mean standard weight for age and height of an individual. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of body fat and health risk.\nBMI = Weight (kg) by Height (meter square)\nMore to Know\nEvery 7 calories of excess consumption leads to 1 gram fat deposit and increase in body weight. Weight due to fat in adipose tissue exceeds more than 20% to 25 % of body weight. An adult weighing 10% more than the standard weight is OVERWEIGHT and 20% more is OBESE.\nCauses and risk factors: Obesity is due to genetic factors, physical inactivity, eating habits (overeating) and endocrine factors. Obesity is a positive risk factor in development of hypertension, diabetes, gall bladder disease, coronary heart disease and arthritis.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The use of natural resources in excess and unplanned way leads to imbalance in the environment. A judicious balance should be maintained between exploitation of resources and its replenishment. Proper utilization and management of nature and its resources is termed as conservation.\nWe have to build a sustainable world, which should last forever. Some of the ways to sustain continuous use of resources are practices to utilise energy efficiently, avoid wastage of water, avoid usage of plastics and other non - biodegradable materials and to take care for the environment we live. It is important that we manage and use our resources carefully so as to preserve for the future generations.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Forests also contribute to the economic development of our country. Forests are vital for human life; it is a source for a wide range of renewable natural resource. They provide wood, food, fodder, fibre and medicine.\nForests are major factor of environmental concern. They act as carbon sink, regulate climatic conditions, increase rainfall, reduce global warming, prevent natural hazards like flood and landslides, protect wildlife and also act as catchments for water conservation. They also play a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

This happens for many reasons like intensive agriculture, urbanization, construction of dams, roads, buildings and industries, hydroelectric projects, forest fires, construction of mountain and forest roads. It is a threat to the economy, quality of life and future of the environment. India is losing about 1. 5 million hectares of forest cover every year.\nMore to Know\nChipko movement\nThe Chipko movement was a non - violent agitation in 1973 that was aimed at protection and conservation of trees. The name of the movement \u2018Chipko\u2019 comes from the word \u2019embrace\u2019, as the villagers hugged the trees and encircled them to prevent them from being cut. The movement originated in the Chamoli district of Uttar Pradesh (now Uttarakhand). The protest of Chipko movement achieved a major victory in 1980 with a 15 - year ban on cutting trees in the Himalayan forests.\nEffects of Deforestation\nDeforestation gives rise to ecological problems like floods, drought, soil erosion, loss of wild life, extinction of species, imbalance of biogeochemical cycles, alteration of climatic conditions and desertification.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The sun gives out vast amount of light and heat. It is only a little less than half (47 %) of solar energy which falls on the atmosphere reaches the earth\u2019s surface. If we could use just a small part of this energy it would fulfil all the country\u2019s need for power. Solar energy has advantages and also certain limitations.\nSolar Energy Devices\nThe energy from the sun can be harnessed to provide power. The various devices used for harnessing sun\u2019s energy are called solar energy devices.\nSolar Cells\nSolar cells (Photovoltaic devices) are made up of silicon that converts sunlight directly into electricity. Solar cell produces electricity without polluting the environment. Since it uses no fuel other than sunlight, no harmful gases, no burning and no wastes are produced. These can be installed in remote and inaccessible areas (forests and hilly regions) where setting up of ^plant is expensive.\nUses of Solar cells\nIt can be used for street lighting, traffic signals, water pumping, battery charging system etc.\nIt is used in artificial satellites and space probes\nIt provides radio and TV transmission to remote areas\nIt is used in calculators, electronic toys and watches.\nSolar Panel\nArrangement of many solar cells side by side connected to each other is called solar panel. The capacity to provide electric current is much increased in the solar panel. But the process of manufacture is very expensive.\nFigure 22. 1 Solar Panel\nSolar Cooker\nIt consists of an insulated metal box or wooden box which is painted from inside so as to absorb maximum solar radiations.

Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted on the oceans of the earth.\nA tidal stream is a fast - flowing body of water created by tides. Turbines are placed in tidal streams. When the tides hit the turbine, the turbine rotates and converts the tidal energy into electric energy\nAdvantages of tidal energy\nTidal energy does not produce any pollution.\nIt does not use any fuel and does not produce any waste.\nTides are predictable, so tidal energy can be produced at any time.\nWater is denser than air and therefore can generate electricity at lower speeds than wind turbines.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

It is a traditional method of storing rain water in underground tanks, ponds, lakes, check dams and used in future.\nThe main purpose of rainwater harvesting is to make the rainwater percolate under the ground so as to recharge \u2018groundwater level\u2019.\nMethods of rainwater harvesting\nRoof top rainwater harvesting: Roof - tops are excellent rain catchers. The rain water that falls on the roof of the houses, apartments, commercial buildings etc. is collected and stored in the surface tank and can be used for domestic purpose.\nRecharge pit: In this method, the rainwater is first collected from the roof tops or open spaces and is directed into the percolation pits through pipes for filtration. After filtration the rainwater enters the recharge pits or ground wells.\nFigure 22. 3 Rain water Harvesting\nPeople living in rural areas adopt a variety of water collecting methods to capture and store as rain water. Some of the methods used are\nDigging of tanks or lakes (Eris):\nIt is one of the traditional waters harvesting system in Tamil Nadu. Eris are constructed in such a way that if the water in one Eris overflows, it automatically gets diverted to the Eris of the next village, as these Eris are interconnected.\nOoranis: These are small ponds to collect rainwater. The water is used for various domestic purposes (drinking, washing and bathing). These ponds cater the nearby villages.\nMore to Know\nkallanai Dam, also known as Grand Anicut, is the fourth oldest dam in the world, constructed by King KarikalaChola of the Cholla Dynasty in the 2nd century A D(CE). It still serves the people of Tamilnadu, the dam is located on the River Kaveri, approximately 20 km from the city of Tiruchirappalli.\nAdvantages of rainwater harvesting\nRainwater harvesting helps to\nOvercome the rapid depletion of ground water levels.\nTo meet the increase demand of water.\nReduces flood and soil erosion\nWater stored in ground is not contaminated by human and animal wastes and hence can be used for drinking purpose.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The solid wastes are dumped in the soil which results in landscape pollution.\nFigure 22. 5 Conventional Wastewater Treatment\nSolid - waste management involves the collection, treatment and proper disposing of solid material that is discarded from the household and industrial activities.\nMethods of solid wastes disposal\nSegregation: It is the separation of different type of waste materials like biodegradable and non - biodegradable wastes.\nSanitary landfill: Solid wastes are dumped into low lying areas. The layers are compacted by trucks to allow settlement. The waste materials get stabilised in about 2 - 12 months. The organic matter undergoes decomposition.\nFigure 22. 6 Collection of degradable and non - degradable solid wastes\nIncineration: It is the burning of non - biodegradable solid wastes (medical wastes) in properly constructed furnace at high temperature.\nComposting: Biodegradable matter of solid wastes is digested by microbial action or earthworms and converted into humus.\nFigure 22. 7 Collection of various types of solid wastes in separate bins\nRecycling of wastes\nPapers from old books, magazines and newspapers are recycled to produce papers in papermills.\nAgricultural wastes like coconut shells, jute cotton stalk, bagasse of sugarcane can be used to make paper and hard board. Paddy husk can be used as livestock fodder.\nCow dung and other organic wastes can be used in gobar gas plant to provide biogas and manure for fields.\n4R Approach\nThe 4R approach such as Reduce, Reuse, Recovery and Recycle may be followed for effective waste management.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

We can create files as per the user\u2019s need. For clear understanding, we can take the example of a bookshelf in a library. The individual book can be considered as a \u2018file\u2019 and the whole set of books in a shelf can be considered as folders. When we right click on the mouse, the popup menu appears on the screen with multiple options. Select \u2018NEW\u2019 option and a secondary menu comes up with another set of options. Select \u2018Folder\u2019 option in the menu. You can now save your file or files in the newly created folder.\nMore people are using Windows and LINUX operating systems in their computers. We can do many activities like collect notes, draw or paint, create animations or spreadsheets or word docs or PPTs etc. .\nWe use \u2018Guide Board\u2019 to go to the unknown places.\nwhen we \u2018On\u2019 the computer click the \u2018START\u2019 button at the left corner of the computer, it shows the list of all programs in the computer. Now select the required program and create the required files.\nHow can we create Files?\nFor example if the computer is operating on the Windows OS, we can collect our notes in \u2018Notepad\u2019 application and draw pictures in \u2018Paint\u2019 application.\nAs per its name we can type notes in \u2018Notepad\u2019 and save the created files in a folder. Likewise in the \u2018Paint\u2019 app we can draw and edit pictures. With these pictures, let us see how we can create image gallery, animations and graphics easily.\nPictures and audio - visuals give us more understanding than teaching and writing on the black board. Is it right?\nInstead of saying a story like \u2018once upon a time there was a king\u2019 we can understand the concept easily by seeing the video and also it registers firmly in the minds of the students. The device which helps in explaining the concepts easily through pictures is known as \u2018Visual Communication Device\u2019. For example photos, audio - visuals, drawings, animations all these can be created easily with the help of computer. Cinema is a good example for \u2018Visual Communication Device\u2019.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

SCRATCH\n\nContent:\nIntroduction\n\u2018Scratch\u2019 is a software used to create animations, cartoons and games easily. Scratch is a visual programming language. It was developed in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab to make programming easier and more fun to learn.\nScratch Environment Editor\nThe Scratch editor has three main parts: They are Stage, Sprite and Script editor.\nStage: Stage is the background appearing when we open the scratch window. The background will most often be white. You can change the background colour as you like.\nSprite: The characters on the background of a Scratch window are known as Sprite. Usually a cat appears as a sprite when the Scratch window is opened. The software provides facilities to make alternations in sprite.\nScript editor or costume editor: Where you edit your programs or your sprite\u2019s pictures.\nYou should see a single window with at least the following three panes: the Stage (top left), the Sprite List (bottom left), and the Scripts tab (right), which contains the Blocks tab and the Scripts Area. The right pane also contains two additional tabs, Costumes and Sounds.\nThe script editor has three main parts:\nScript area: Where you build scripts.\nBlock menu: Where you choose the category of blocks (programming statements) to use.\nBlock palette: Where you choose the block to use.\nWhen the Costumes tab is chosen, the costume editor is shown (outlined in red):\nMovement and Loops\nClick File, and click New to create a new project and enter a project name.\nClick the menuScript \u2192 Event, drag a when green flag clickedblock to the scripts area. Your scripts area should look like this:\nClick the menuScript \u2192 Motionmenu, drag ago to x: 0 y: 0 block to the scripts area and snap it to the bottom of thewhen green flag clicked block. Your script should look like this:\nAdd a move 10 steps block to the bottom of your script and change the 10 into 100.\nClick the green flag at the top right corner of the stage to run your program.\nAdding Sound\nClick Sprite1 in the sprite list and click the Sounds tab.\nTry the meow sound already there. If you don\u2019t like it, click the speaker icon to choose a different sound from the sound library.\nClick the Scripts tab and find the play sound block from the Sound menu. Add this block to the when space key pressed script. (Select the sound you want from the drop - down list. )\nRun your program.\nProgram for print the word \u201cHello\u201d with sound\nClick events in script option\nDrag when clicked tab to script area\nClick Looks in script option. Drag \u201csay\u201d to script area.\nType \u201cHello \u201cword in say tab.\nClick sounds in script option. Drag play sound to script area. Choose the hello sound from the audio file.\nFrom File menu choose the Save option.\nClick the green flag at the top right corner of the stage window to run the program\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

TEST THE GIVEN SAMPLE FOR THE PRESENCE OF ACID OR BASE\n\nContent:\nTo identify the presence of an acid or a base in a given sample.\nMaterials Required:\nTest tubes, test tube stand, glass rod, phenolphthalein, methyl orange, sodium carbonate salt and the given sample.\nIn acid medium,\nPhenolphthalein is colourless\nMethyl orange is pink in colour\nSodium carbonate gives brisk effervescence.\nIn Base medium,\nPhenolphthalein is pink in colour\nMethyl orange is yellow in colour\nSodium carbonate does not give brisk effervescence.\nSerial number\nObservation\n(Colour change)\n(Acid or Base)\nTake 5ml of the test Solution in a test tube and add a few drops of Phenolphthalein in it.\na) No change in colour.\nb) Solution Turns pink in colour\na) Presence of acid\nb) Presence of base\nTake 5ml of the test Solution in a test tube and add a few drops of Methyl orange in it.\na) Solution Turns pink in colour\nb) Solution Turns yellow in colour\na) Presence of acid\nb) Presence of base\nTake 5ml of the test Solution in a test tube and add a pinch of sodium carbonate salt.\na) Brisk effervescence occurs.\nb) No brisk effervescence.\na) Presence of acid\nb) Presence of base\nResult: The given test Solution contains \u2014 (acid or base).\nPHOTOSYNTHESIS - TEST TUBE AND FUNNEL EXPERIMENT (DEMONSTRATION)\nTo prove that oxygen is evolved during photosynthesis.\nMaterials required:\nTest tube, funnel, beaker, pond water and Hydrilla plant.\nTake a few twigs of Hydrilla plant in a beaker containing pond water.\nPlace an inverted funnel over the plant.\nInvert a test tube filled with water over the stem of the funnel.\nKeep the apparatus in the sunlight for few hours.\nObservation:\nAfter one hour, it is noted that water gets displaced down from the test tube.\nDuring photosynthesis, oxygen is evolved as a by - product. Gas bubbles liberated from the Hydrilla plant reach the top of the test tube and it displaces the water downwards. Take the test tube and keep the burning stick near the mouth of the test tube. Increased flame will appear. Hence, it is proved that oxygen is evolved during photosynthesis.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Heat energy always flows from one body to the other due to a temperature difference between them. Thus, you can define thermal equilibrium in another way. If two bodies are said to be in thermal equilibrium, then, they will be at the same temperature. What will happen if two bodies at different temperatures are brought in contact with one other? There will be a transfer of heat energy from the hot body to the cold body until a thermal equilibrium is established between them. This is depicted in Figure 3. 1.\nFigure 3. 1 Establishing thermal equilibrium\nWhen a cold body is placed in contact with a hot body, some thermal energy is transferred from the hot body to the cold body. As a result, there is some rise in the temperature of the cold body and decrease in the temperature of the hot body. This process will continue until these two bodies attain the same temperature.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The hotness of the milk decreases after some time. Similarly, if you keep a bottle of cold water on a table, the water becomes warmer after some time. What do you infer from these observations? In the case of hot milk, there is a flow of energy from the cup of milk to the environment. In the second case, the energy is transferred from the environment to the water bottle. This energy is termed as \u201cthermal energy\u201d.\nWhen a hot object is in contact with another cold object, a form of energy flows from the hot object to the cold object, which is known as thermal energy. Thus, thermal energy is a form of energy which is transferred between any two bodies due to the difference in their temperatures. Thermal energy is also known as 'heat energy' or simply 'heat'.\nHeat energy is the agent, which produces the sensation of warmth and makes bodies hot. The process in which heat energy flows from a body at a higher temperature to another object at lower temperature is known as heating. This process of transmission of heat may be done in any of the ways like conduction, convection or radiation. Heat is a scalar quantity. The SI unit of heat energy absorbed or evolved is joule (J)\nDuring the process of transferring heat energy, the body at lower temperature is heated while the body at higher temperature is cooled. Thus, some \u00d7 , this process of transfer of heat energy is termed as 'cooling'. But, in most of the cases the term 'heating' is used instead of 'cooling'. When the thermal energy is transferred from one body to another, this results in the rise or lowering of the temperature of either of the bodies.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

This change in the dimension due to rise in temperature is called thermal expansion of the object. The expansion of liquids (example mercury) can be seen when a thermometer is placed in warm water. All forms of matter (solid, liquid and gas) undergo expansion on heating.\nWhen a solid is heated, the atoms gain energy and vibrate more vigorously. This results in the expansion of the solid. For a given change in temperature, the extent of expansion is smaller in solids than in liquids and gases. This is due to the rigid nature of solids.\nThe different types of expansion of solid are listed and explained below:\nLinear expansion\nSuperficial expansion\nCubical expansion\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Cubical expansion:\n\nContent:\nIf there is an increase in the volume of a solid body due to heating, then the expansion is calledcubical or volumetric expansion.\nAs in the cases of linear and areal expansion, cubical expansion is also expressed in terms of coefficient of cubical expansion. The ratio of increase in volume of the body per degree rise in temperature to its unit volume is called ascoefficient of cubical expansion. This is also measured in Kelvin ^ - one\nFigure 3. 4 Cubical expansion\nThe equation relating to the change in volume and the change in temperature is given below:\nDeltaV by V o equal to alpha V \u00d7 delta T\nDelta V - Change in volume (Final volume - Initial volume)\nV o - Original volume\nDeltaT - Change in temperature (Final temperature - Initial temperature)\nAlpha V - Coefficient of cubical expansion.\nDifferent materials possess different coefficient of cubical expansion. Table 3. 1 gives the coefficient of cubical expansion for some common materials.\nTable 3. 1Coefficient of cubical expansion of some materials\nSerial number\nName of the material\nCoefficient of cubic expansion(K ^ - one)\n7 \u00d7 ten ^ - five\n6 \u00d7 ten ^ - five\n2. 5 \u00d7 ten ^ - five\n20. 7 \u00d7 ten ^ - five\n18. 2 \u00d7 ten ^ - five\nWhen heated, the atoms in a liquid or gas gain energy and are forced further apart. The extent of expansion varies from substance to substance. For a given rise in temperature, a liquid will have more expansion than a solid and a gaseous substance has the highest expansion when compared with the other two. The coefficient of cubical expansion of liquid is independent of temperature whereas its value for gases depends on the temperature of gases.\nWhen a liquid is heated, it is done by keeping the liquid in some container and supplying heat energy to the liquid through the container. The thermal energy supplied will be partly used in expanding the container and partly used in expanding the liquid. Thus, what we observe may not be the actual or real expansion of the liquid. Hence, for liquids, we can define real expansion and apparent expansion.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Thus, in practice, you can heat any liquid by pouring it in a container. A part of thermal energy is used in expanding the container and a part is used in expanding the liquid. Thus, what you observe is not the actual or real expansion of the liquid. The expansion of a liquid apparently observed without considering the expansion of the container is called the apparent expansion of the liquid.\nCoefficient of apparent expansion is defined as the ratio of the apparent rise in the volume of the liquid per degree rise in temperature to its unit volume.

Mark this level as L1. Now, heat the container and the liquid using a burner as shown in the Figure 3. 5. Initially, the container receives the thermal energy and it expands. As a result, the volume of the liquid appears to have reduced. Mark this reduced level of liquid as L2.\nOn further heating, the thermal energy supplied to the liquid through the container results in the expansion of the liquid. Hence, the level of liquid rises to L3. Now, the difference between the levels L1 and L3 is called asapparent expansion, and the difference between the levels L2 and L3 is called real expansion. The real expansion is always more than that ofapparent expansion.\nFigure 3. 5 Real and apparent expansion of liquid\nReal expansion = L 3 - L 2\nApparent expansion = L 3 - L 1\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The molecules of any gas will have a certain amount of interaction among them. But these interactions are weaker when the pressure is low or the temperature is high because the interatomic or intermolecular forces of attraction are weak in ideal gas. Hence, a real gas at low pressure or high temperature can be termed as a perfect gas.\nIdeal gases obey Boyle\u2019s law, Charles\u2019s law and Avogadro\u2019s law. All these laws state the relationship between various properties of a gas such as pressure (P), volume (V), temperature(T) and number of atoms (n). In a given state of the gas, all these parameters will have a definite set of values. When there is a change in the state of the gas, any one or more of these parameters change its value. The above said laws relate these changes.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

An ideal gas obeys Boyle\u2019s law and Charles\u2019 law and Avogadro\u2019s law.\nAccording to Boyle\u2019s law,\nPV is equal to a constantequation (3. 1)\nAccording to Charles\u2019s law,\nV by T is equal to a constant equation 3. 2\nAccording to Avogadro\u2019s law,\nV by n is equal to a constant equation 3. 3\nAfter combining equations (3. 1), (3. 2) and (3. 3), you can get the following equation.\nPV by n T is equal to constant equation 3. 4\nThe above relation is called the combined law of gases. If you consider a gas, which contains moles of the gas, the number of atoms contained will be equal to \u00d7 the Avogadro number, NA.\nThat is n is equal to mew N A equation 3. 5\nUsing equation (3. 5), equation (3. 4) can be written as\nPV by mew N A T is equal to a constant\nThe value of the constant in the above equation is taken to be k B, which is called as Boltzmann constant (1. 38 \u00d7 10 ^ - 23 joule kelvin ^ - one. Hence, we have the following equation:\nPV by mew N A T is equal to K B\nPV is equal to mew N A K B T\nHere, mew N A k Bis equal to R, which is termed as universal gas constant whose value is 8. 31 joule mole ^ - one kelvin ^ - one.\nPV is equal to RTequation (3. 6)\nIdeal gas equation is also called as equation of state because it gives the relation between the state variables and it is used to describe the state of any gas.\nPoints to Remember\nThe SI unit of heat energy absorbed or evolved is joule (J)\nHeat always flows from a system at higher temperature to a system at lower temperature.\nTemperature is defined as the degree of hotness of a body. The SI unit of temperature is kelvin (K).\nAll the substances will undergo one or more of the following changes when heated:\nTemperature of the substance rises.\nThe substance may change state from solid to liquid or gas.\nThe substance will expand when heated.\nAll forms of matter (solid, liquid and gas) undergo expansion on heating.\nFor a given rise in temperature, a liquid will have more expansion than a solid and a gaseous substance has the highest expansion than the other two.\nIf a liquid is heated directly without using any container, then the expansion that you observe is termed as real expansion of the liquid.\nThe expansion of a liquid apparently observed without considering the expansion of the container is called the apparent expansion of liquid.\nFor a given heat energy, the real expansion is always more than that of apparent expansion.\nIf the atoms or molecules of a gas do not interact with each other, then the gas is said to be an ideal gas or a perfect gas.\nIdeal gas equation, also called as equation of state is PV = RT. Here, R is known as universal gas constant whose value is.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

It is defined as the rate of flow of charges in a conductor. This means that the electric current represents the amount of charges flowing in any cross section of a conductor (say a metal wire) in unit time. If a net charge \u2018Q\u2019 passes through any cross section of a conductor in time \u2018t\u2019, then the current flowing through the conductor is I is equal to Q by T equation 4. 1\n4. 1. 2SI unit of electric current\nThe SI unit of electric current is ampere (A). The current flowing through a conductor is said to be one ampere, when a charge of one coulomb flows across any cross - section of a conductor, in one second. Hence, 1 ampere is equal to one coulomb / one second.\nSolved Problem 1\nA charge of 12 coulomb flows through a bulb in 5 second. What is the current through the bulb?\nCharge Q = 12 Coulomb, Time t = 5 second. Therefore, current I = Q by t = 12 by 5 = 2. 4 Amphere\nTable 4. 1 Symbols of some components of a circuit\nUSE OF THE COMPONENT\nSYMBOL USED\nUsed to fix the magnitude of the current through a circuit\nVariable resistor or Rheostat\nUsed to select the magnitude of the current through a circuit.\nUsed to measure the current.\nUsed to measure the potential difference.\nGalvanometer\nUsed to indicate the direction of current.\nIt is used in electronic devises.\nLight Emitting Diode (LED)\nIt is used in seven segment display.\nGround connection\nUsed to provide protection to the electrical components.

This path is made using electrical wires so as to connect an electric appliance to a source of electric charges (battery). A schematic diagram of an electric circuit comprising of a battery, an electric bulb, and a switch is given in Figure 4. 2.\nFigure 4. 2 A simple electric circuit\nIn this circuit, if the switch is \u2018on\u2019, the bulb glows. If it is switched off, the bulb does not glow. Therefore, the circuit must be closed in order that the current passes through it. The potential difference required for the flow of charges is provided by the battery. The electrons flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal of the battery.\nBy convention, the direction of current is taken as the direction of flow of positive charge (or) opposite to the direction of flow of electrons. Thus, electric current passes in the circuit from the positive terminal to the negative terminal.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

You also know that there must be a difference in temperature between two points in a solid for the heat to flow in it. Similarly, a difference in electric potential is needed for the flow of electric charges in a conductor. In the conductor, the charges will flow from a point in it, which is at a higher electric potential to a point, which is at a lower electric potential.\n4. 3. 1 Electric Potential\nThe electric potential at a point is defined as the amount of work done in moving a unit positive charge from infinity to that point against the electric force.\n4. 3. 2 Electric Potential Difference\nThe electric potential difference between two points is defined as the amount of work done in moving a unit positive charge from one point to another point against the electric force.\nFigure 4. 3 Electric potential\nSupposeyou have moved a charge Q from a point A to another point B. Let \u2018W\u2019 be the work done to move the charge from A to B. Then, the potential difference between the points A and B is given by the following expression:\nPotential difference V is equal to Work done / Chargeequation 4. 2\nPotential difference is also equal to the difference in the electric potential of these two points. If VA and VB represent the electric potential at the points A and B respectively, then, the potential difference between the points A and B is given by:\nV = VA - VB (if VA is more than VB)\nV = VB - VA (if VB is more than VA)\nThe SI unit of electric potential or potential difference is volt (V) The potential difference between two points is one volt, if one joule of work is done in moving one coulomb of charge from one point to another against the electric force.\n1volt = one joule by one coulomb\nSolved Problem 2\nThe work done in moving a charge of 10 Coulomb across two points in a circuit is 100 Joule.

This relationship can be understood from the following activity.\nFigure 4. 4 Electric circuit to understand Ohm\u2019s law\nAccording to Ohm\u2019s law, at a constant temperature, the steady current \u2018I\u2019 flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference \u2018V\u2019 between the two ends of the conductor.\nI proportional to V. Hence, I by V is equal to constant\nThe value of this proportionality constant is found to be one by R\nTherefore, I is equal to open (1 by R close) V\nV = I Requation (4. 3)\nHere, R is a constant for a given material (say Nichrome) at a given temperature and is known as the resistance of the material. Since, the potential difference V is proportional to the current I, the graph between V and I is a straight line for a conductor, as shown in the Figure 4. 5.\nFigure 4. 5 Relation between potential difference and current\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

If you replace the Nichrome wire with a copper wire and conduct the same experiment, you will notice a different current for the same value of the potential difference across the wire. If you again replace the copper wire with an aluminium wire, you will get another value for the current passing through it. From equation (4. 3), you have learnt that Vby I must be equal to the resistance of the conductor used. The variations in the current for the same values of potential difference indicate that the resistance of different materials is different. Now, the primary question is, \u201cwhat is resistance? \u201d\nResistance of a material is its property to oppose the flow of charges and hence the passage of current through it. It is different for different materials.\nFrom Ohm\u2019s Law V by I is equal to R\nThe resistance of a conductor can be defined as the ratio between the potential difference across the ends of the conductor and the current flowing through it.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The conductance of a material is mathematically defined as the reciprocal of its resistance (R). Hence, the conductance \u2018G\u2019 of a conductor is given by\nG is equl to one by R. equation 4. 5\nItsunit isohm^ - one it isalso represented as mho.\nThe r reciprocal of electrical resistivity of a material is called its electrical conductivity. Sigma is equal to one by rho equation 4. 6\nIts unit is ohm ^ - 1 metre ^ - 1. It is also represented as mho metre ^ - 1. The conductivity is a constant for a given material. Electrical conductivity of a conductor is a measure of its ability to pass the current through it. Some materials are good conductors of electric current. Example: copper, aluminium, etc. . While some other materials are non - conductors of electric current (insulators). Example: glass, wood, rubber, etc.\nConductivity is more for conductors than for insulators.

A series circuit has only one loop through which current can pass. If the circuit is interrupted at any point in the loop, no current can pass through the circuit and hence no electric appliances connected in the circuit will work. Series circuits are commonly used in devices such as flashlights. Thus, if resistors are connected end to end, so that the same current passes through each of them, then they are said to be connected in series.\nFigure 4. 6 Series connection of resistors\nLet, three resistances R1, R2 and R3 be connected in series (Figure 4. 6). Let the current flowing through them be I. According to Ohm\u2019s Law, the potential differences V1, V2 and V3 across R1, R2 and R3 respectively, are given by:\nV1 = I R1(4. 7)\nV2 = I R2 (4. 8)\nV3 = I R3(4. 9)\nThe sum of the potential differences across the ends of each resistor is given by:\nV = V1 + V2 + V3\nUsing equations (4. 7), (4. 8) and (4. 9), we get V = I R1 + I R2 + I R3(4. 10)\nThe effective resistor is a single resistor, which can replace the resistors effectively, so as to allow the same current through the electric circuit. Let, the effective resistance of the series - combination of the resistors, be RS. Then,\nV = I RS(4. 11)\nCombining equations (4. 10) and (4. 11), you get,\nI RS = I R1 + I R2 + I R3\nRS = R1 + R2 + R3(4. 12)\nThus, you can understand that when a number of resistors are connected in series, their equivalent resistance or effective resistance is equal to the sum of the individual resistances. When \u2018n\u2019 resistors of equal resistance R are connected in series, the equivalent resistance is \u2018n R\u2019.\nTht is, RS is equal to n R\nThe equivalent resistance in a series combination is greater than the highest of the individual resistances.\nSolved Problem5\nThree resistors of resistances 5 ohm. , 3 ohm and 2 ohms are connected in series with 10 V battery. Calculate their effective resistance and the current flowing through the circuit.\nR1 = 5 ohm, R2 = 3 ohm, R3 = 2 ohm, V = 10 Volt\nR s = R1 + R2 + R3, Rs = 5 + 3 + 2 = 10, hence R s = 10 \u03a9\nThe current, I = V by R s equal to ten by ten equal to 1 ampere.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

If the circuit is disconnected in one of the loops, the current can still pass through the other loop(s). The wiring in a house consists of parallel circuits.\nFigure 4. 7 Parallel connections of resistors\nConsider that three resistors R1, R2 andR3 are connected across two common points A and B. The potential difference across each resistance is the same and equal to the potential difference between A and B. This is measured using the voltmeter. The current I arriving at A divides into three branches I1, I2 and I3 passing through R1, R2 and R3 respectively.\nAccording to the Ohm\u2019s law, you have,\nI one is equal to V by R one equation 4. 13\nI2 is equal to V by R twoequation 4. 14\nI3 is equal to V by R threeequation 4. 15\nThe total current through the circuit is given by\nI = I 1 + I 2 + I 3\nUsing equations (4. 13), (4. 14) and (4. 15), you get\nI is equal to V by Rone + V by R two + V by R threeequation 4. 16\nLet the effective resistance of the parallel combination of resistors be R p. Then,\nI is equal to V by R p equation 4. 17\nCombining equations (4. 16) and (4. 17), you have\nV by Rp is equal to V by R one + V by R2 + V by R3\nOne by R p = 1 by R 1 + 1 by R 2 + 1 by R 3 equation 4. 18\nThus, when a number of resistors are connected in parallel, the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances is equal to the reciprocal of the effective or equivalent resistance. When \u2018n\u2019 resistors of equal resistances R are connected in parallel, the equivalent resistance is R by n.\nthat is one by R p is equal to one by R + one by R + one by R and so on + 1 by R is equal to n by R\nhence Rp is equal to R by n\nThe equivalent resistance in a parallel combination is less than the lowest of the individual resistances.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

What do you observe? The motor casing is warm. This is due to the heating effect of current. The same can be observed by touching a bulb, which was used for a long duration. Generally, a source of electrical energy can develop a potential difference across a resistor, which is connected to that source. This potential difference constitutes a current through the resistor. For continuous drawing of current, the source has to continuously spend its energy. A part of the energy from the source can be converted into useful work and the rest will be converted into heat energy. Thus, the passage of electric current through a wire, results in the production of heat. This phenomenon is called heating effect of current.

The charge flowing through the circuit for a time interval \u2018t\u2019 is \u2018Q\u2019.\nThe work done in moving the charge Q across the ends of the resistor with a potential\ndifference of V is VQ. This energy spent by the source gets dissipated in the resistor as heat. Thus, the heat produced in the resistor is:\nYou know that the relation between the charge and current is Q = I t. Using this, you get\nH = V I t(4. 19)\nFrom Ohm\u2019s Law, V = I R. Hence, you have\nH = I ^2 R t(4. 20)\nThis is known as Joule\u2019s law of heating.\nJoule\u2019s law of heating states that the heat produced in any resistor is:\ndirectly proportional to the square of the current passing through the resistor.\ndirectly proportional to the resistance of the resistor.\ndirectly proportional to the time for which the current is passing through the resistor.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Electric Heating Device:\nThe heating effect of electric current is used in many home appliances such as electric iron, electric toaster, electric oven, electric heater, geyser, etc. . In these appliances Nichrome, which is an alloy of Nickel and Chromium is used as the heating element. Why? Because:\n(1)it has high resistivity, (2) it has a high melting point, (3) it is not easily oxidized.\n2. Fuse Wire:\nThe fuse wire is connected in series, in an electric circuit. When a large current passes through the circuit, the fuse wire melts due to Joule\u2019s heating effect and hence the circuit gets disconnected. Therefore, the circuit and the electric appliances are saved from any damage. The fuse wire is made up of a material whose melting point is relatively low.\n3. Filament in bulbs:\nIn electric bulbs, a small wire is used, known as filament. The filament is made up of a material whose melting point is very high. When current passes through this wire, heat is produced in the filament. When the filament is heated, it glows and gives out light. Tungsten is the commonly used material to make the filament in bulbs.\nSolved Problem - 6\nAn electric heater of resistance 5 ohm is connected to an electric source. If a current of 6 Ampere flows through the heater, then find the amount of heat produced in 5 minutes.\nGiven resistance R = 5 ohm, Current I = 6 Ampere, Time t = 5 minutes = 5 \u00d7 60 second = 300 second\nAmount of heat produced, H = I ^2Rt, H = 6 ^2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 300. Hence, H = 54000 Joule\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Similarly, the electric ^is defined as the rate of consumption of electrical energy. It represents the rate at which the electrical energy is converted into some other form of energy.\nSuppose a current \u2018I\u2019 flows through a conductor of resistance \u2018R\u2019 for a time \u2018t\u2019, then the potential difference across the two ends of the conductor is \u2018V\u2019. The work done \u2018W\u2019 to move the charge across the ends of the conductor is given by the equation (4. 19) as follows:\n^P = work by time = V I t by t\nP = V I(4. 21)\nThus, the electric ^is the product of the electric current and the potential difference due to which the current passes in a circuit.\n4. 9. 1 Unit of Electric Power\nThe SI unit of electric ^is watt. When a current of 1 ampere passes across the ends of a conductor, which is at a potential difference of 1 volt, then the electric ^is\nP = 1 volt \u00d7 1 ampere = 1 watt\nThus, one watt is the ^consumed when an electric device is operated at a potential difference of one volt and it carries a current of one ampere. A larger unit of power, which is more commonly used is kilowatt.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Consumption of electricity is based on two factors: (1) Amount of electric ^and (2) Duration of usage. Electrical energy consumed is taken as the product of electric ^and time of usage. For example, if 100 watt of electric ^isconsumed for two hours, then the ^consumed is100 \u00d7 2 = 200watt hour. Consumption of electrical energy is measured and expressed in watt hour, though its SI unit is watt second. In practice, a larger unit of electrical energy is needed. This larger unit is kilowatt hour (kWh). One kilowatt hour is otherwise known as one unit of electrical energy. One kilowatt hour means that an electric ^of 1000 watt has been utilized for an hour. Hence,\n1 kWh = 1000watt hour = 1000 \u00d7 (60 \u00d7 60) watt second = 3. 6 \u00d7 10 ^6 Joul\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The diagram, which shows the general scheme of a domestic electric circuit, is given in Figure 4. 10In our homes, electricity is distributed through the domestic electric circuits wired by the electricians. The first stage of the domestic circuit is to bring the ^supply to the main - box from a distribution panel, such as a transformer. The important components of the main - box are: (1) a fuse box and (2)a meter. The meter is used to record the consumption of electrical energy. The fuse box contains either a fuse wire or a miniature circuit breaker (MCB). The function of the fuse wire or a MCB is to protect the house hold electrical appliances from overloading due to excess current\nFigure 4. 10 Domestic electric circuit\nYou have learnt about a fuse wire in section4. 8. 2. An MCB is a switching device, which can be activated automatically as well as manually. It has a spring attached to the switch, which is attracted by an electromagnet when an excess current passes through the circuit. Hence, the circuit is broken and the protection of the appliance is ensured. Figure 4. 11 represents a fuse and an MCB.\nFigure 4. 11 A fuse and an MCB\nThe electricity is brought to houses by two insulated wires. Out of these two wires,\none wire has a red insulation and is called the \u2018live wire\u2019. The other wire has a black insulation and is called the \u2018neutral wire\u2019. The electricity supplied to your house is actually an alternating current having an electric potential of 220 Volt. Both, the live wire and the neutral wire enter into a box where the main fuse is connected with the live wire. After the electricity meter, these wires enter into the main switch, which is used to discontinue the electricity supply whenever required. After the main switch, these wires are connected to live wires of two separate circuits. Out of these two circuits, one circuit is of a 5 Ampere rating, which is used to run the electric appliances with a lower ^rating, such as tube lights, bulbs and fans. The other circuit is of a 15 Ampererating, which is used to run electric appliances with ahigh - ^rating, such as air - conditioners, refrigerators, electric iron and heaters. It should be noted that all the circuits in a house are connected in parallel, so that the disconnection of one circuit does not affect the other circuit. One more advantage of the parallel connection of circuits is that each electric appliance gets an equal voltage.\nDo you know?\nIn India domestic circuits are supplied with an alternating current of potential 220 or 230 volt. And frequency 50 hertz. In countries like U S A and U K domestic circuits are supplied with an alternating current of potential of 110 or 120 volt and frequency of 60 hertz.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Over loading happens when a large number of appliances are connected in series to the same source of electric power. This leads to a flow of excess current in the electric circuit.\nWhen the amount of current passing through a wire exceeds the maximum permissible limit, the wires get heated to such an extent that a fire may be caused. This is known as overloading. When a live wire comes in contact with a neutral wire, it causes a \u2018short circuit\u2019. This happens when the insulation of the wiresgets damaged due to temperature changes or some external force. Due to a short circuit, the effective resistance in the circuit becomes very small, which leads to the flow of a large current through the wires. This results in heating of wires to such an extent that a fire may be caused in the building.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The other end of the earth wire is connected to a metal tube or a metal electrode, which is buried into the Earth. This wire provides a low resistance path to the electric current. The earth wire sends the current from the body of the appliance to the Earth, whenever a live wire accidentally touches the body of the metallic electric appliance. Thus, the earth wire serves as a protective conductor, which saves us from electric shocks.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

An LED TV is actually an LCD TV (Liquid Crystal Display) with LED display. An LED display uses LEDs for backlight and an array of LEDs act as pixels. LEDs emitting white light are used in monochrome (black and white) TV; Red, Green and Blue (RGB) LEDs are used in colour television. The first LED television screen was developed by James. Mitchell in 1977. It was a monochromatic display. But, after about three decades, in 2009, SONY introduced the first commercial LED Television.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

How does sound reach our ears from various sources? What is sound? Is it a force or energy? Let us answer all these questions.\nFigure 5. 1 Production of sound waves\nBy touching a ringing bell or a musical instrument while it is producing music, you can conclude that sound is produced by vibrations. The vibrating bodies produce energy in the form of waves, which are nothing but sound waves (Figure 5. 1). Suppose you and your friend are on the Moon. Will you be able to hear any sound produced by your friend? As the Moon does not have air, you will not be able to hear any sound produced by your friend. Hence, you understand that the sound produced due to the vibration of different bodies needs a material medium like air, water, steel, etc. , for its propagation. Hence, sound can propagate through a gaseous medium or a liquid medium or a solid medium.\nTake a squeaky toy or old mobile phone and put it inside a plastic bag. Seal the bag with the help of a candle or with a thread. Fill a bucket with water and place the bag in the water bucket and squeeze the toy or ring the mobile. You will hear a low sound. Now place your ear against the side of the bucket and squeeze the toy or ring the mobile phone again. You will hear a louder sound.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

As sound travels through a medium, the particles of the medium vibrate along the direction of propagation of the wave. This displacement involves the longitudinal displacements of the individual molecules from their mean positions. This results in a series of high - and low - pressure regions called compressions and rarefactions as shown in figure 5. 2.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

SI unit of velocity is metre second ^ - one. .\nParticle velocity:\nThe velocity with which the particles of the medium vibrate in order to transfer the energy in the form of a wave is called particle velocity.\nWave velocity:\nThe velocity with which the wave travels through the medium is called wave velocity. In other words, the distance travelled by a sound wave in unit time is called the velocity of a sound wave.\nVelocity = distance travelled by time\nIf the distance travelled by one wave is taken as one wavelength (\u03bb) and, the time taken for this propagation is one time period (T), then, the expression for velocity can be written as\nTherefore V is equal to lambta by T equation 5. 1\nTherefore, velocity can be defined as the distance travelled per second by a sound wave. Since, Frequency (n) is equal to 1, equation (5. 1) can be written as\nV = n \u03bb equation (5. 2)\nVelocity of a sound wave is maximum in solids because they are more elastic in nature than liquids and gases. Since, gases are least elastic in nature, the velocity of sound is the least in a gaseous medium.\nSo, v Sgreater than v L greater than V G\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Elastic property of solids is characterized by their elastic moduli. The speed of sound is directly proportional to the square root of the elastic modulus and inversely proportional to the square root of the density. Thus, the velocity of sound in solids decreases as the density increases whereas the velocity of sound increases when the elasticity of the material increases. In the case of gases, the following factors affect the velocity of sound waves.\nEffect of density: The velocity of sound in a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of the density of the gas. Hence, the velocity decreases as the density of the gas increases.\nV is proportional to square root of one by d\nEffect of temperature: The velocity of sound in a gas is directly proportional to the square root of its temperature. The velocity of sound in a gas increase with the increase in temperature. V\u221d\u221aT. Velocity at temperature T is given by the following equation:\nV T = (v 0 + 0. 61 T) meter second ^ - one. VT is equal to V0 + zero point six one T with in the bracket metre second ^ - one\nHere, V 0 is the velocity of sound in the gas at 0\u00b0 C. For air, V 0 = 331 meter second ^ - one. Hence, the velocity of sound changes by 0. 61 metre second ^ - one when the temperature changes by one degree Celsius.\nEffect of relative humidity: When humidity increases, the speed of sound increases. That is why you can hear sound from long distances clearly during rainy seasons.\nSpeed of sound waves in different media are given in table 5. 1\nTable 5. 1 Speed of sound in different media\nof the medium\nName of the Medium\nSpeed of sound(in meter second ^ - one)\nAir (at 0degree Celsius)\nAir (at 20degree celsius)\nExample Problem 5. 1\n1. At what temperature will the velocity of sound in air be double the velocity of sound in air at 0degree Celsius\nLet T degree celsius be the required temperature. Let V 1and V 2 be the velocity of sound at temperatures\nT 1 Kelvin and T 2 kelvin respectively. T 1 = 273 Kelvin (0 degree celsius) and T 2 = (T degree Celsius + 273) Kelvin\nV 2 by V 1 = square root of T 2 by T 1 = square root of 273 + T / square root of 273 = 2\nHere it is given that V 2 by V 1 = 2\nSo, 273 + T / 273 = 4\nT = (273 \u00d7 4) - 273 = 819degree Celsius.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

This is nothing but the reflection of the sound waves that you produce. Let us discuss about the reflection of sound in detail through the following activity.\nWhen sound waves travel in a given medium and strike the surface of another medium, they can be bounced back into the first medium. This phenomenon is known as reflection. In simple the reflection and refraction of sound is actually similar to the reflection of light. Thus, the bouncing of sound waves from the interface between two media is termed as the reflection of sound. The waves that strike the interface are termed as the incident wave and the waves that bounce back are termed as the reflected waves, as shown in Figure 5. 3\nFigure 5. 3 Reflection of sound\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The following two laws of reflection are applicable to sound waves as well.\nThe incident wave, the normal to the reflecting surface and the reflected wave at the point of incidence lie in the same plane.\nThe angle of incidence\u2220i is equal to the angle of reflection\u2220r.\nThese laws can be observed from Figure 5. 4.\nFigure 5. 4 Laws of reflection\nIn the above Figure 5. 4, the sound waves that travel towards the reflecting surface are called the incident waves. The sound waves bouncing back from the reflecting surface are called reflected waves. For all practical purposes, the point of incidence and the point of reflection is the same point on the reflecting surface.\nA perpendicular line drawn at the point of incidence is called the normal. The angle which the incident sound wave makes with the normal is called the angle of incidence, \u2018i\u2019. The angle which the reflected wave makes with the normal is called the angle of reflection, \u2018r\u2019.\nAcoustical wonder of Golconda fort (Hyderabad, Telangana)\nThe Clapping portico in Golconda Fort is a series of arches on one side, each smaller than the preceding one.

Suppose a compression travelling in air from left to right reaches a rigid wall. The compression exerts a force F on the rigid wall. In turn, the wall exerts an equal and opposite reaction R = - F on the air molecules. This results in a compression near the rigid wall. Thus, a compression travelling towards the rigid wall is reflected back as a compression. That is the direction of compression is reversed (Figure 5. 5).\nFigure 5. 5 Reflection of sound at a denser medium\nConsider a wave travelling in a solid medium striking on the interface between the solid and the air. The compression exerts a force F on the surface of the rarer medium. As a rarer medium has smaller resistance for any deformation, the surface of separation is pushed backwards (Figure 5. 6). As the particles of the rarer medium are free to move, a rarefaction is produced at the interface. Thus, a compression is reflected as a rarefaction and a rarefaction travel from right to left.\nFigure 5. 6 Reflection of sound at a rarer medium\nMore to know:\nWhat is meant by rarer and denser medium?

The intensity of the reflected wave is neither decreased nor increased. But, when the sound waves are reflected from the curved surfaces, the intensity of the reflected waves is changed. When reflected from a convex surface, the reflected waves are diverged out and the intensity is decreased. When sound is reflected from a concave surface, the reflected waves are converged and focused at a point So the intensity of reflected waves is concentrated at a point. Parabolic surfaces are used when it is required to focus the sound at a particular point. Hence, many halls are designed with parabolic reflecting surfaces. In elliptical surfaces, sound from one focus will always be reflected to the other focus, no matter where it strikes the wall.\nThis principle is used in designing whispering halls. In a whispering hall, the speech of a person standing in one focus can be heard clearly by a listener standing at the other focus.\nDo You Know?\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The sound, which you hear is called an echo. It is due to the reflection of sound. One does not experience any echo sound in a small room. This does not mean that sound is not reflected in a small room. This is because smaller rooms do not satisfy the basic conditions for hearing an echo.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The persistence of hearing for human ears is 0. 1 second. This means that you can hear two sound waves clearly, if the time interval between the two sounds is at least 0. 1 s. Thus, the minimum time gap between the original sound and an echo must be 0. 1 second.\n2. The above criterion can be satisfied only when the distance between the source of sound and the reflecting surface would satisfy the following equation:\nvelocity is equal to distance travelled by sound / time taken\nV is equal to 2d by t\nd is equal to vt by two\nSince, t is equal to 0. 1 second, then d is equal to v into zero point one / two is equal to v / twenty.\nThus, the minimum distance required to hear an echo is 1 by20th part of the magnitude of the velocity of sound in air. If you consider the velocity of sound as 344theminimum distance required to hear an echo is 17. 2 m.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Measure the distance \u2018d\u2019 between the source of sound pulse and the reflecting surface using the measuring tape.\n2. The receiver is also placed adjacent to the source. A sound pulse is emitted by the source.\n3. The stopwatch is used to note the time interval between the instant at which the sound pulse is sent and the instant at which the echo is received by the receiver. Note the time interval as \u2018t\u2019.\n4. Repeat the experiment for three or four \u00d7 . The average time taken for the given number of pulses is calculated.\nCalculation of speed of sound:\nThe sound pulse emitted by the source travels a total distance of 2d while travelling from the source to the wall and then back to the receiver. The time taken for this has been observed to be \u2018t\u2019. Hence, thespeed of sound wave is givenby speed of sound equal to distance travelled / time taken = 2 \u00d7 d / t.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Sound board\nThese are basically curved surfaces (concave), which are used in auditoria and halls to improve the quality of sound. This board is placed such that the speaker is at the focus of the concave surface. The sound of the speaker is reflected towards the audience thus improving the quality of sound heard by the audience.\n5. 4. 2. Ear trumpet\nEar trumpet is a hearing aid, which is useful by people who have difficulty in hearing. In this device, one end is wide, and the other end is narrow. The sound from the sources falls into the wide end and are reflected by its walls into the narrow part of the device. This helps in concentrating the sound and the sound enters the ear drum with more intensity. This enables a person to hear the sound better.\n5. 4. 3. Megaphone\nA megaphone is a horn - shaped device used to address a small gathering of people. It\u2019s one end is wide, and the other end is narrow. When a person speaks at the narrow end, the sound of his speech is concentrated by the multiple reflections from the walls of the tube. Thus, his voice can be heard loudly over a long distance.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

This apparent change in frequency was first observed and explained by Christian Doppler (1803to1853), an Austrian Mathematician and Physicist. He observed that the frequency of the sound as received by a listener is different from the original frequency produced by the source whenever there is a relative motion between the source and the listener. This is known as Doppler effect This relative motion could be due to various possibilities as follows:\nThe listener moves towards or away from a stationary source\nThe source moves towards or away from a stationary listener\nBoth source and listener move towards or away from one other\nThe medium moves when both source and listener are at rest\nWhenever there is a relative motion between a source and a listener, the frequency of the sound heard by the listener is different from the original frequency of sound emitted by the source. This is known as \u201cDoppler effect\u201d.\nFigure 5. 7 Source and listener moving towards each other\nFor simplicity of calculation, it is assumed that the medium is at rest. That is the velocity of the medium is zero. Let S and L be the source and the listener moving with velocities vSand vLrespectively. Consider the case of source and listener moving towards each other (Figure 5. 7). As the distancebetween them decreases, the apparent frequency will be more than the actual source frequency.\nLet n and n dashbe the frequency of the sound produced by the source and the sound observed by the listener respectively. Then, the expression for the apparent frequency n' is\nn \u2014 is equal to v + v1 by v - vs into n\nHere, v is the velocity of sound waves in the given medium. Let us consider different possibilities of motions of the source and the listener. In all such cases, the expression for the apparent frequency is given in table 5. 2.\nTable 5. 2 Expression for apparent frequency due to Doppler effect\nCase Number.\nPosition of source and listener\nExpression for apparent frequency\nBoth source and listener move\nThey move towards each other\na)Distance between source and listener decreases. b)Apparent frequency is more than actual frequency.\na)Distance between source and listener decreases.\nb)Apparent frequency is more than actual frequency.\nN \u2014 equal to v + v1 / v - vs in to n\nBoth source and listener move\nThey move away from each other\na)Distance between source and listener increases. b)Apparent frequency is less than actual frequency. c)vSandLbecome opposite to that in case1.\na)Distance between source and listener increases.\nb)Apparent frequency is less than actual frequency.\nc)vSandLbecome opposite to that in case1.\nN dahs equal to v - v1 by v + vs in to n\nBoth source and listener move\nThey move one behind the other\nSource follows the listener\na)Apparent frequency depends on the velocities of the source and the listener. b)vSbecomes opposite to that in case2.\na)Apparent frequency depends on the velocities of the source and the listener.\nb)vSbecomes opposite to that in case2.\nN dah equal to v - v1 by v - vs into n\nBoth source and listener move\nThey move one behind the other\nListener follows the source\na)Apparent frequency depends on the velocities of the source and the listener. b)vSand vLbecome opposite to that in case3.\na)Apparent frequency depends on the velocities of the source and the listener.\nb)vSand vLbecome opposite to that in case3.\nN \u2014 is equal to v + v1 by v + vs into n\nSource at rest Listener moves towards the source\na)Distance between source and listener decreases. b)Apparent frequency is more than actual frequency. c)vS = 0 incase1.\na)Distance between source and listener decreases.\nb)Apparent frequency is more than actual frequency.\nc)vS = 0 incase1.\nN \u2014 is equal to v + v1 by v into n\nSource at rest Listener moves away from the source\na)Distance between source and listener increases. b)Apparent frequency is less than actual frequency. c)vS = 0 incase2.\na)Distance between source and listener increases.\nb)Apparent frequency is less than actual frequency.\nc)vS = 0 incase2.\nN \u2014 is equal to v - v1 by v into n\nListener at rest\nSource moves towards the listener\na)Distance between source and listener decreases. b)Apparent frequency is more than actual frequency. c)vL = 0 incase1.\na)Distance between source and listener decreases.\nb)Apparent frequency is more than actual frequency.\nc)vL = 0 incase1.\nN \u2014 is equal to v by v - vs into n\nListener at rest Source moves away from the listener\na)Distance between source and listener increases. b)Apparent frequency is less than actual frequency. c)vL = 0 incase2.\na)Distance between source and listener increases.\nb)Apparent frequency is less than actual frequency.\nc)vL = 0 incase2.\nN \u2014 is equal to v by v + vs into n\nSuppose the medium (say wind) is moving with a velocity W in the direction of the propagation of sound. For this case, the velocity of sound, \u2018v\u2019 should be replaced with (v + W). If the medium moves in a direction opposite to the propagation of sound, then \u2018v\u2019 should be replaced with (v - W).\nSolved problems\n1. A source producing a sound of frequency 90 Hz is approaching a stationary listener with a speed equal to (1by10) of the speed of sound. What will be the frequency heard by the listener?\nSolution: When the source is moving towards the stationary listener, the expression for apparent frequency is\n2. A source producing a sound of frequency 500 Hz is moving towards a listener with a velocity of 30 metre second ^ - 1. The speed of the sound is 330 metre second ^ - 1. What will be the frequency heard by listener?\nSolution: When the source is moving towards the stationary listener, the expression for apparent frequency is\nn \u2014 is equal to v by v - v s whole bracket into n\nn \u2014 is equal to 330 by 330 - 30 whole bracket into 500 = 550 Hz\n3. A source of sound is moving with a velocity of 50 meter second ^ - 1 towards a stationary listener. The listener measures the frequency of the source as 1000 Hz. what will be the apparent frequency of the source when it is moving away from the listener after crossing him? (Velocity of sound in the medium is 330 meter second ^ - 1)\nSolution: When the source is moving towards the stationary listener, the expression for apparent frequency is\nn \u2014 = v / v \u2013 v s whole bracket multiplied by n\n1000 = 330 / 330 - 50 whole bracket multiplied by n\nn = 1000 \u00d7 280 / 330\nn = 848. 48 Hz.\nThe actual frequency of the sound is 848. 48 Hz. When the source is moving away from the stationary listener, the expression for apparent frequency is\nn \u2014 = open (v / v + v s close) multiplied by n\n= open (330 / 330 + 50 closed) multiplied by 848. 48\n4. A source and listener are both moving towards each other with a speed v by 10 where v is the speed of sound. If the frequency of the note emitted by the source is f, what will be the frequency heard by the listener?\nSolution: When source and listener are both moving towards each other, the apparent frequency is\nn \u2014 = open (v + v l / v - v s close) multiplied by n\nn \u2014 = open (v + v by 10 / v - v by 10 close) multiplied by n\nn \u2014 = 11 / 9 multiplied by f\n5. At what speed should a source of sound move away from a stationary observer so that observer finds the apparent frequency equal to half of the original frequency?\nSolution: When the source is moving away from the stationary listener, the expression for the apparent frequency is\nn \u2014 = open (v by v + v s close) multiplied by n\nn by 2 = open (v by v + v s close) multiplied by n\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Things around us are made up of atoms. A Greek Philosopher 'Democritus' in 400 BC believed that matter is made up of tiny indestructible units called atoms. Later, in 1803, John Dalton considered that elements consist of atoms, which are identical in nature. J J Thomson discovered cathode rays, known as electrons, experimentally and Goldstein discovered positive rays, which were named as protons by Rutherford. In 1932, James Chadwick discovered the charge less particles called neutrons. Presently, a large number of elementary particles like photon, meson, positron and neutrino have been discovered. In 1911, the British scientist, Ernest Rutherford explained that the mass of an atom is concentrated in its central part called Nucleus. You have already learnt about the atomic structure in the earlier classes.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

By chance, an unexposed photographic plate was also stored in the same drawer. After a week he returned and noticed that the film had been exposed to some radiation. He discovered that he could reproduce the effect whenever he placed uranium near a photographic film. Apparently, uranium radiated something that could affect a photographic plate. This phenomenon was called as Radioactivity. Uranium was identified to be a radioactive element.\nTwo years later, the Polish physicist Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie detected radioactivity in 'Pitchblende', a tiny black substance. They were not surprised at the radioactivity of pitchblende, which is known as an ore of uranium. Later, they discovered that the radiation was more intense from pure uranium. Also, it was found that the pitchblende had less concentration of uranium. Theyconcluded that some other substance was present in pitchblende. After separating this new substance, they discovered that it had unknown chemical properties and it also emitted radiations spontaneously like uranium. They named this new substance as 'Radium'. The radioactive elements emit harmful radioactive radiations like alpha rays or beta rays or gamma rays.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Artificial radioactivity is induced in certain lighter elements like boron, aluminium etc. , by bombarding them with radiations such as 'alpha particles' emitted during the natural radioactivity of uranium. This also results in the emission of invisible radiations and elementary particles. During such a disintegration, the nucleus which undergoes disintegration is called 'parent nucleus' and that which is produced after the disintegration is called a 'daughter nucleus'. The particle, which is used to induce the artificial disintegration is termed as projectile and the particle which is produced after the disintegration is termed as ejected particle. When the projectile hits the parent nucleus, it is converted into an unstable nucleus, which in turn decays spontaneously emitting the daughter nucleus along with an ejected particle.\nTable 6. 1 Comparison between Natural and Artificial Radioactivity\nNaturalradioactivity\nArtificial radioactivity\nEmission of radiation due to self - disintegration of a nucleus.\nEmission of radiation due to disintegration of a nucleus through induced process.\nAlpha, beta and gamma radiations are emitted.\nMostly elementary particles such as neutron, positron, etc. . . . are emitted.\nIt is a spontaneous process.\nIt is an induced process.\nExhibited by elements with atomic number more than83.\nExhibited by elements with atomic number less than83.\nThis cannot be controlled.\nThis can be controlled.\nActivity 6. 1\nUsing the periodic table, list out the radioactive elements. Also identify the name of the groups in which they are present.\nIf you denote the parent and daughter nuclei as X and Y respectively, then the nuclear disintegration is represented as follows: X (P, E) Y. Here, P and E represent the projectile particle and ejected particle respectively.\nIn the above nuclear reaction, 6 Carbon 13 is unstable and is radioactive.\nThis reaction can be represented as 4 Beryllium 9 (\u03b1, n)6 Carbon 12.\n4 Beryllium 9 + 2 helium 4 gives 6 carbon 12 + 1 neutron.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

These three neutrons in turn can cause fission in three other uranium nuclei present in the sample, thus producing nine neutrons. These nine neutrons in turn may produce twenty - seven neutrons and so on. This is known as 'chain reaction'. A chain reaction is a self - propagating process in which the number of neutrons goes on multiplying rapidly almost in a geometrical progression.\nTwo kinds of chain reactions are possible. They are: (One) controlled chain reaction and (Two)uncontrolled chain reaction.\n(a)Controlled chain reaction\n(a)Controlled chain reaction\nIn the controlled chain reaction, the number of neutrons released is maintained to be one. This is achieved by absorbing the extra neutrons with a neutron absorber leaving only one neutron to produce further fission. Thus, the reaction is sustained in a controlled manner. The energy released due to a controlled chain reaction can be utilized for constructive purposes. Controlled chain reaction is used in a nuclear reactor to produce energy in a sustained and controlled manner.\n(b) Uncontrolled chain reaction\nIn the uncontrolled chain reaction, the number of neutrons multiplies indefinitely and causes fission in a large amount of the fissile material. This results in the release of a huge amount of energy within a fraction of a second. This kind of chain reaction is used in the atom bomb to produce an explosion. Figure 6. 3 represents an uncontrolled chain reaction.\nFigure 6. 3 Uncontrolled chain reaction\n6. 3. 4 Critical Mass\nDuring a nuclear fission process, about 2 to 3 neutrons are released. But all these neutrons may not be available to produce further fission. Some of them may escape from the system, which is termed as 'leakage of neutrons' and some may be absorbed by the non - fissionable materials present in the system. These two factors lead to the loss of neutrons. To sustain the chain reaction, the rate of production of neutrons due to nuclear fission must be more than the rate of its loss. This can be achieved only when the size (That is mass) of the fissionable material is equal to a certain optimum value. This is known as 'critical mass'.\nThe minimum mass of a fissile material necessary to sustain the chain reaction is called' critical mass (mc)'. It depends on the nature, density and the size of the fissile material.\nIf the mass of the fissile material is less than the critical mass, it is termed as 'subcritical'. If the mass of the fissile material is more than the critical mass, it is termed as 'supercritical'.\nActivity 6. 2\nUsing beads make a chain reaction model\n6. 3. 5 Atom bomb\nThe atom bomb is based on the principle of uncontrolled chain reaction. In an uncontrolled chain reaction, the number of neutrons and the number of fission reactions multiply almost in a geometrical progression. This releases a huge amount of energy in a very small - time interval and leads to an explosion.\nAn atom bomb consists of a piece of fissile material whose mass is subcritical. This piece has a cylindrical void. It has a cylindrical fissile material which can fit into this void and its mass is also subcritical. When the bomb has to be exploded, this cylinder is injected into the void using a conventional explosive. Now, the two pieces of fissile material join to form the supercritical mass, which leads to an explosion. The structure of an atom bomb is shown in Figure 6. 4\nFigure 6. 4 Atom bomb\nDuring this explosion tremendous amount of energy in the form of heat, light and radiation is released. A region of very high temperature and pressure is formed in a fraction of a second along with the emission of hazardous radiation like \u03b3 rays, which adversely affect the living creatures. This type of atom bombs was exploded in 1945 at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan during the World War II.\nDo You Know?\nElectron Volt it read as eV is the unit used in nuclear physics to measure the energy of small particles.

The average energy released in each fusion reaction is about 3. 84 \u00d7 10 power - 12 Joule. Figure 6. 5 represents this.\nThe mass of the daughter nucleus formed during a nuclear reaction (fission and fusion) is lesser than the sum of the masses of the two parent nuclei. This difference in mass is called mass defect. This mass is converted into energy, according to the mass - energy equivalence. This concept of mass - energy equivalence was proposed by Einstein in 1905. It stated that mass can be converted into energy and vice versa. The relation between mass and energy proposed by Einstein is\nE = mc ^2 where c is the velocity of light in vacuum and is equal to 3 \u00d7 10 ^of 8.\nDo you Know\nThe nuclear bomb that was dropped in Hiroshima during World War II was called as\n'Little boy'. It was a gun - type bomb which used a uranium core. The bomb, which was subsequently dropped over Nagasaki was called as 'Fat man'.

If nuclear fusion is a spontaneous process at normal temperature and pressure, then a number of fusion processes would happen in the atmosphere which may lead to explosions. But we do not encounter any such explosions. Can you explain why?\nThe answer is that nuclear fusion can take place only under certain conditions.\nNuclear fusion is possible only at an extremely high temperature of the order of 10 ^of 7 to\n10 ^of 9 Kelvin and a high pressure to push the hydrogen nuclei closer to fuse with each other. Hence, it is named as 'Thermonuclear reaction'.\nDo you know\nNuclear fusion is the combination of two lighter nuclei. The charge of both nuclei is positive. According to electrostatic theory, when they come closer, they tend to repel each other. This repulsive force will be overcome by the kinetic energy of the nuclei at higher temperature of the order of 10 ^of 7 to 10 ^of 9 Kelvin.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The surface temperature of the stars is very high which is sufficient to induce fusion of the hydrogen nuclei.\nFusion reaction that takes place in the cores of the Sun and other stars results in an enormous amount of energy, which is called as 'stellar energy. Thus, nuclear fusion or thermonuclear reaction is the source of light and heat energy in the Sun and other stars.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

A hydrogen bomb is always designed to have an inbuilt atom bomb which creates the high temperature and pressure required for fusion when it explodes. Then, fusion takes place in the hydrogen core and leads to the release of a very large amount of energy in an uncontrolled manner. The energy released in a hydrogen bomb (or fusion bomb) is much higher than that released in an atom bomb (or fission bomb).\nTable 6. 3 Features of Nuclear fission and nuclear fusion\nSerial Number\nNUCLEAR FISSION\nNUCLEAR FUSION\nThe process of breaking up (splitting) of a heavy nucleus in to two smaller nuclei is called'nuclear fission'.\nNuclear fusion is the combination of two lighter nuclei to form a heavier nucleus.\nCan be performed at room temperature.\nExtremely high temperature and pressure\nAlpha, beta and gamma radiations are emitted.\nAlpha rays, positrons, and neutrinos are emitted.\nFission leads to emission of gamma radiation. This triggers the mutation in the human gene and causes genetic transform diseases.\nOnly light and heat energy is emitted.\nDo you know\nSun fuses about 620 million metric tons of hydrogen each second and radiates about\n3. 8 \u00d7 10 ^of 26 joule s energy per second. When this energy is radiated towards the Earth, it decreases in its intensity. When it reaches the Earth, its value is about 1. 4 kilo joule per unit area in unit time.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

These radio isotopes have found wide variety of applications in the fields of medicine, agriculture, industry and archaeological research.\n6. 5. 1. Agriculture\nThe radio isotope of phosphorous (Phosphorous - 32) helps to increase the productivity of crops.\nThe radiations from the radio isotopes can be used to kill the insects and parasites and prevent the wastage of agricultural products. Certain perishable cereals exposed to radiations remain fresh beyond their normal life, enhancing the storage time. Very small doses of radiation prevent sprouting and spoilage of onions, potatoes and gram.\n6. 5. 2. Medicine\nMedical applications of radio isotopes can be divided into two parts:\nFirst) Diagnosis, Second) Therapy.\nRadio isotopes are used as tracers to diagnose the nature of circulatory disorders of blood, defects of bone metabolism, to locate tumours, etc. Some of the radio isotopes which are used as tracers are: hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, sulphur, edcetera.\nRadio sodium (sodium 24 ) is used for the effective functioning of heart.\nRadio \u2013 Iodine (Iodine 131 ) is used to cure goitre.\nRadio - iron is (Iron 59 ) is used to diagnose anaemia and also to provide treatment for the same.\nRadio phosphorous (phosphorous 32 ) is used in the treatment of skin diseases.\nRadio cobalt (Cobalt 60 ) and radio - gold (Gold198 ) are used in the treatment of skin cancer.\nRadiations are used to sterilize the surgical devices as they can kill the germs and microbes.\n6. 4. 3. Industries\n6. 4. 3. Industries\nIn industries, radioactive isotopes are used as tracers to detect any manufacturing defects such as cracks and leaks. Packaging faults can also be identified through radio activity. Gauges, which have radioactive sources are used in many industries to check the level of gases, liquids and solids.\nAn isotope of californium (californium252 ) is used in the airlines to detect the explosives in the luggage.\nAn isotope of Americium (Americium 241 ) is used in many industries as a smoke detector.\n6. 5. 4 Archaeological research\nUsing the technique of radio carbon dating, the age of the Earth, fossils, old paintings and monuments can be determined. In radio carbon dating, the existing amount of radiocarbon is determined, and this gives an estimate about the age of these things.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The radioactive elements present in the soil and rocks, the household appliances like television, microwave ovens, cell phones and the X - rays used in hospitals. These radiations do not produce any severe effects as they are very low in intensity.\nThe second source of radiation exposure is man - made. These are due to nuclear reactors and during the testing of the nuclear devices in the atmosphere or in the ground.\nImproper and careless handling of radioactive materials release harmful radiations in our environment. These radiations are very harmful to the human body. A person who is exposed to radiations very closely or for a longer duration, is at a greater health risk and can be affected genetically.\nDo you Know\nHow old is our mother Earth? Any guess? ? It is nearly 4. 54 \u00d7 10 ^of 9 years (around 45 Crore 40 lakh years). Wow! !\n6. 6. 1. Permitted range\nThe International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) has recommended certain maximum permissible exposure limits to radiation that is believed to be safe without producing any appreciable injury to a person. Safe limit of overall exposure to radiation is given as 20 milli sievert per year. In terms of roentgen, the safe limit of receiving the radiation is about 100 milli Roentgen per week. If the exposure is 100 Roentgen, it may cause fatal diseases like leukaemia (death of red blood corpuscle in the blood) or cancer. When the body is exposed to about 600 Roentgen, it leads to death.\nDo you Know\nDosimeter is a device used to detect the levels of exposure to an ionizing radiation. It is frequently used in the environments where exposure to radiation may occur such as nuclear ^plants and medical imaging facilities.

Graphite and heavy water are the commonly used moderators.\nThird one is, Control rod: Control rods are used to control the number of neutrons in order to have sustained chain reaction. Mostly boron or cadmium rods are used as control rods. They absorb the neutrons.\nFourth one is, Coolant: A coolant is used to remove the heat produced in the reactor core, to produce steam. This steam is used to run a turbine in order to produce electricity. Water, air and helium are some of the coolants.\nLast one is, Protection wall: A thick concrete lead wall is built around the nuclear reactor in order to prevent the harmful radiations from escaping into the environment.\n6. 7. 3.

Matter is made of atoms. Curiously the idea of atom was first proposed by the Greek philosophers in the fifth century BC (BCE). But their theory was more philosophical than scientific.\nThe first scientific theory of the atom was proposed by John Dalton. Few of the postulates of Dalton\u2019s theory about an atom were found incorrect by the later on studies made by J. J. Thomson, Rutherford, Neils Bohr and Schrodinger. In the light of the result of the research most of the limitations of the Dalton\u2019s theory wereremoved and a new theory known as the modern atomic theory was put forward. \u2018The main postulates of modern atomic theory\u2019 are as follows:\nAn atom is no longer indivisible (after the discovery of the electron, proton, and neutron).\nAtoms of the same element may have different atomic mass. (Discovery of isotopes 17Cl35, 17Cl37).\nAtoms of different elements may have same atomic masses (discovery of Isobars 18Ar40, 20Ca40).\nAtoms of one element can be transmuted into atoms of other elements. In other words, atom is no longer indestructible (discovery of artificial transmutation).\nAtoms may not always combine in a simple whole number ratio (Example Glucose C6H12O6 C is to H is to O = 6 is to 12 is to 6 or 1 is to 2 is to 1 and Sucrose C12H22O11 C is to H is to O = 12 is to 22 is to 11).\nAtom is the smallest particle that takes part in a chemical reaction.\nThe mass of an atom can be converted into energy (E = mc ^2).\nThe modern atomic theory is the basis for all the studies of chemical and physical processes that involve atoms. You have studied the most fundamental ideas about an atom in your lower classes. Let us discuss some more concepts about atoms in this lesson.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Atoms are the building blocks of matter. Since matter has mass, it must be due to its atoms. According to the modern atomic theory, an atom contains subatomic particles such as protons, neutrons and electrons. Protons and neutrons have considerable mass, but electrons don't have such a considerable mass. Thus, the mass of an atom is mainly contributed by its protons and neutrons and hence the sum of the number of protons and neutrons of an atom is called its mass number.\nIndividual atoms are very small, and it is difficult to measure their masses. You can measure the mass of macroscopic materials in gram or kilogram. The mass of an atom is measured in atomic mass unit (amu).\nAtomic mass unit is one - twelfth of the mass of a carbon - 12 atom; an isotope of carbon, which contains 6 protons and 6 neutrons.\n(Note: The symbol \u2018amu\u2019 is no longer used in the modern system and instead, it uses the symbol \u2018u\u2019 to denote unified atomic mass. The mass of a proton or neutron is approximately 1 amu).\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The early pioneers of chemistry used to measure the atomic mass of an atom relative to an atom of another element. They measured the masses of equal number of atoms of two or more elements at a time, to determine their relative masses. They established one element as a standard, gave it an arbitrary value of atomic mass and using this value they measured the relative mass of other elements. The mass obtained by this way is called relative atomic mass. In the beginning, the mass of hydrogen atom was chosen as a standard and masses of other atoms were compared with it, because of the existence of isotopic character of hydrogen (1H1, 1H2, 1H3). Later hydrogen atom was replaced by oxygen atom as the standard. Now, the stable isotope of carbon (C - 12) with atomic mass 12 is used as the standard for measuring the relative atomic mass of an element.\nRelative atomic mass of an element is the ratio between the average mass of its isotopes to\n1 by 12 th part of the mass of a carbon - 12 atom. It is denoted as Ar. It is otherwise called \u201cStandard Atomic Weight\u201d.\nRelative Atomic Mass\nModern methods of determination of atomic mass by Mass Spectrometry uses C - 12 as standard. For most of the elements, the relative atomic mass is very closer to a whole number, and it is rounded off to a whole number, to make calculations easier. Table 7. 1 lists some of the elements of periodic table and their Relative Atomic mass values.\nTable 7. 1 Relative atomic mass of elements (C - 12 Scale)\nRelative atomic mass\nDo you Know\nRelative Atomic Mass is only a ratio, so it has no unit. If the atomic mass of an element is expressed in grams, it is called as Gram Atomic Mass\nGram Atomic Mass of hydrogen = 1 gram\nGram Atomic Mass of carbon = 12 gram\nGram Atomic Mass of nitrogen = 14 gram\nGram Atomic Mass of oxygen = 16 gram\n7. 0. 2Average Atomic Mass (AAM)\n7. 0. 2Average Atomic Mass (AAM)\nHow can one measure the atomic mass of an element? It is somewhat more complicated because most of the naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes, each of which has its own mass. Thus, it is essential to consider this isotopic mixture while calculating the atomic mass of an element.\nThe average atomic mass of an element is the weighted average of the masses of its naturally occurring isotopes.\nBut, the abundance of isotopes of each element may differ. So, the abundancy of all these isotopes is taken into consideration while calculating the atomic mass. Then, what do we mean by a weighted average?\nLet us consider an element which exists as a mixture of 50% of an isotope having a mass of 9 amu, and 50% of another isotope having a mass of 10 amu. Then, its average atomic mass is calculated by the following equation:\nAverage atomic mass\n= (Mass of 1st isotope \u00d7 % abundance of 1st isotope) + (Mass of 2nd isotope \u00d7 % abundance of 2nd isotope) Thus, for the given element the average\n(Note: In the calculations involving percentages, you need to convert percentage abundance into fractional abundance. For example, 50 percent is converted into 50 by 100 or 0. 50 as shown in a foresaid calculation. )\nThe atomic masses of elements, given in the periodic table, are average atomic masses. Some \u00d7 , the term atomic weight is used to mean average atomic mass. It is observed, from the periodic table that atomic masses of most of the elements are not whole numbers. For instance, the atomic mass of carbon given in the periodic table is 12. 01 amu, not 12. 00 amu. The reason is that while calculating the atomic mass of carbon, both of its natural isotopes such as carbon - 12. and carbon - 13 are considered. The natural abundance of C - 12 and C - 13 are 98. 90 % and 1. 10 % respectively. The average of the atomic mass of carbon is calculated as follows:\nSo, it is important to understand that if it is mentioned that the atomic mass of carbon is 12 amu, it refers to the average atomic mass of the carbon isotopes, not the mass of the individual atoms of carbon.\nTable 7. 2 Atomic mass of some elements\nAtomic Number\nAtomicMass unit(amu)\nCalculation of average atomic mass \u2013 Solved Examples\nExample 1: Oxygen is the most abundant element in both the Earth\u2019s crust and the human body.

Thus, a molecule may be an element or a compound. If the molecule is made of similar kind of atoms, then it is called homoatomic molecule.\nThe molecule that consists of atoms of different elements is called heteroatomic molecule. A compound is a heteroatomic molecule. The number of atoms present in the molecule is called its \u2018atomicity\u2019.\nTable 7. 4 Classification of molecules\nNumber of atomspresent\nLet us consider oxygen. Oxygen gas exists in two allotropic forms: Oxygen (O2) and Ozone (O3). In oxygen molecule, there are two oxygen atoms. So, its atomicity is two.

If a molecule contains more than three atoms, then it is calledpolyatomic molecule.\nConsider hydrogen chloride. It consists of two atoms, but of different elements, that is hydrogen and chlorine. So, its atomicity is two. It is a hetero diatomic molecule. Similarly, the water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. So, its atomicity is three. It is a hetero triatomic molecule.\nFigure 7. 2 Heteroatomic molecules\nActivity7. 2\nClassify the following molecules based on their atomicity and fill in the table:\nHydrogeniodide (H I), Sulphuric acid (H2 s o 4), Methane(CH4), Glucose(C6H12O6), Carbon monoxide(C O)\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The mass of the molecule of an element or compound is measured in the C - 12 scale and hence called relative molecular mass. The Relative Molecular Mass of a molecule is the ratio between the mass of one molecule of the substance to 1 by 12 th mass of an atom of Carbon 12\nDo you Know\nRelative Molecular Mass is only a ratio. So, it has no unit. If the molecular mass of a compound is expressed in grams, it is called Gram Molecular Mass.\nGram Molecular Mass of water = 18gram\nGram Molecular Mass of carbon dioxide = 44gram\nGram MolecularMass of ammonia = 17gram\nGram Molecular Mass of HCl = 36. 5gram\nThe relative molecular mass is obtained by adding together the relative atomic masses of all the atoms present in a molecule.\nCalculation of relative molecular mass \u2013 Solved examples:\nExample 1: Relative molecular mass of sulphuric acid (H2SO4) is calculated as follows: Sulphuric acid contains 2 atoms of hydrogen, 1 atom of sulphur and 4 atoms of oxygen.\nTherefore, Relative molecular mass of sulphuric acid = (2 \u00d7 mass of hydrogen) + (1 \u00d7 mass of sulphur) + (4 \u00d7 mass of oxygen)\n= (2 \u00d7 1) + (1 \u00d7 32) + (4 \u00d7 16)\nThat is one molecule of H2SO4 is 98 \u00d7 as heavy as 1 by 12 the of the mass of a carbon 12.\nExample 2: Relative molecular mass of water (H2O) is calculated as follows: A water molecule is made of 2 atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.\nSo, the relative molecular mass of water\n= (2 \u00d7 mass of hydrogen) + (1 \u00d7 mass of oxygen)\n= (2 \u00d7 1) + (1 \u00d7 16)\nThat is one molecule of H2O is 18 \u00d7 as heavy as1 by 12 thof the mass of a carbon 12.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Atomic mass units provide a relative scale for the masses of the elements. Since the atoms have such small masses, no usable scale can be devised to weigh them in the calibrated units of atomic mass units. In any real situation, we deal with macroscopic samples containing enormous number of atoms. Therefore, it is convenient to have a special unit to describe a very large number of atoms. The idea of a \u2018unit\u2019 to denote a particular number of objects is not new. For example, the pair (2 items) and the dozen (12 items), are all familiar units. Chemists measure atoms and molecules in moles. So, you can now understand that \u2018mole\u2019 denotes a number of particles.\nIn the SI system, the mole (mol) is the amount of a substance that contains as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, or other particles) as there are atoms in exactly 12 gram (or 0. 012 kg) of the carbon 12 isotope. The actual number of atoms in 12 gram of carbon 12 is determined experimentally. This is called\nAvogadro\u2019s Number (NA), named after an Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro who proposed its significance. Its value is 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23. So, one mole of a substance contains 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23 entities. Thus, 5 moles of oxygen molecules contain 5 \u00d7 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23 molecules.\nMole Concept: The study of the collection of particles by using mole as the counting unit, in order to express the mass and volume of such unit particles in a bulk of matter is known as mole concept.\nThe number of moles of a substance can be calculated by various means depending on the data available, as follows:\nNumber of moles of molecules.\nNumber of moles of atoms.\nNumber of moles of a gas (Standard molar volume at STP = 22. 4 litre).\nNumber of moles of ions.\nSTP - StandardTemperatureand Pressure (273. 15 Kelvin, 1. 00 standard atmosphere pressure)\nMole of atoms:\nOne mole of an element contains6. 023 \u00d7 10^23 atoms and it is equal to its gram atomic mass.\nThat is, one mole of oxygen contains 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23 atoms of oxygen, and its gram atomic mass is 16 gram.\nMole of molecules:\nOne mole of matter contains 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23 molecules, and it is equal to its gram molecular mass.\nThat is, onemole of oxygencontains 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23 molecules of oxygen and its gram molecular mass is 32 gram.\nMolar volume:\nOne mole of any gas occupies 22. 4 litre or 22400 ml at S. T. P. This volume is called as molar volume.\nCalculation of number of moles by Different modes\nNumber of moles\n= Mass by Atomic Mass\n= Mass by Molecular mass\n= Number of Atoms by 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23\n= Number of Molecules by 6. 023 \u00d7 10 ^23\nFigure 7. 3 Mole concept\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Relative molecular mass: (Hydrogen scale)\nThe Relative Molecular Mass of a gas or vapour is the ratio between the mass of one molecule of the gas or vapour to mass of one atom of Hydrogen.\nVapour Density:\nVapour density is the ratio of the mass of a certain volume of a gas or vapour, to the mass of an equal volume of hydrogen, measured under the same conditions of temperature and pressure.\nVapour Density (V. D. )\nAccording to Avogadro's law, equal volumes of all gases contain equal number of molecules.\nThus, let the number of molecules in one volume = n, then\nVapour density at standard Temperature and pressure\nCancelling 'n' which is common, you get\nHowever, since hydrogen is diatomic\nWhen you compare the formula of vapour density with relative molecular mass, they can be represented as\n(Equation7. 1)\nRelative molecular mass (hydrogen scale)\n(Equation 7. 2)\nYou can therefore substitute the above equation to an Equation 7. 1 and arrive at the following formula\nNow on cross multiplication, you have 2 * vapour density equal to Relative molecular mass of a gas\nRelative molecular mass = 2 * Vapour density\n7. 9SOLVED PROBLEMS7. 10\n7. 9SOLVED PROBLEMS\nI.

By 1860, scientists had already discovered 60 elements and determined their atomic masses. They noticed that some elements had similar properties and hence arranged them into groups. During this period, several new elements were discovered. These elements were found to have different properties. It was realized that instead of studying the properties of all these elements individually, it would be more convenient to divide them into groups and periods in such a way that each group contained a certain number of elements (like an array of fruits and vegetables showing orderliness) with similar properties and periods showing a regular gradation. So, scientists made several attempts to arrange elements in a logical way. You have studied about all these early attempts of arrangement of elements in standard IX. In continuation of the knowledge gained in the topic periodic classification of elements in standard IX with earlier concepts and their subsequent deliberations, you get set to go ahead with the higher order of thinking to enhance your knowledge on the properties of elements.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

For example, the atomic mass of argon (39. 95 amu) is greater than that of potassium (39. 10 amu), but argon comes before potassium in the periodic table. If elements were arranged solely according to increasing atomic mass, argon would appear in the position occupied by potassium in our modern periodic table (see in Figure 8. 1). No chemist would place argon, a gas with no tendency to react, in the same group as lithium and sodium, which are two highly reactive metals. This kind of discrepancies suggested that some fundamental property other than atomic mass must be the basis of periodicity. The fundamental property turned out to be the number of protons in an atom\u2019s nucleus, something that could not have been known by Mendeleev and his contemporaries.\nHenry Moseley, a British scientist in 1912, discovered a new property of elements called atomic number, which provided a better basis for the periodic arrangement of the elements. It is a well - known fact that atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons or the number of electrons present in the neutral atom of an element. The periodic law was, therefore, modified to frame a modern periodic law, which states that\n\u201cThe physical and chemical properties of the elements are the periodic functions of\ntheir atomic numbers\u201d.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

The modern periodic table is a tabular arrangement of elements in rows and columns, highlighting the regular repetition of properties of the elements. Figure 8. 1 shows the modern periodic table of 118 elements discovered so far.\nAs you have studied the features of the modern periodic table in standard IX, here let us confine to the study of the features of periods and groups.\nFeatures of Periods\nThe horizontal rows are called periods. There are seven periods in the periodic table.\nFirst period (Atomic number 1 and 2): This is the shortest period. It contains only two elements (Hydrogen and Helium).\nSecond period (Atomic number 3 to 10): This is a short period. It contains eight elements (Lithium to Neon).\nThird period (Atomic number 11 to 18): This is also a short period. It contains eight elements (Sodium to Argon).\nFourth period (Atomic number 19 to 36): This is a long period. It contains eighteen elements (Potassium to Krypton). This includes 8 representative elements and 10 transition elements.\nFifth period (Atomic number 37 to 54): This is also a long period. It contains 18 elements (Rubidium to Xenon). This includes 8 representative elements and 10 transition elements.\nSixth period (Atomic number 55 to 86): This is the longest period. It contains 32 elements (Caesium to Radon). This includes 8 representative elements, 10 transition elements and 14 inner transition elements (Lanthanides).\nSeventh period (Atomic number 87 to 118): Like the sixth period, this period also accommodates 32 elements. Recently 4 elements have been included by IUPAC.\nFeatures of Groups\nThe vertical columns in the periodic table starting from top to bottom are called groups. There are 18 groups in the periodic table.\nBased on the common characteristics of elements in each group, they can be grouped as various families.\nGroup Number\nAlkali Metals\nAlkaline earth metals\nTransition metals\nBoronFamily\nCarbon Family\nNitrogen Family\nOxygen Family(or)\nChalcogen family\nNoble gases\nThe Lanthanides and Actinides, which form part of Group 3 are called inner transition elements.\nExcept 'group 18', all the elements present in each group have the same number of electrons in their valence shell and thus have the same valency. For example, all the elements of group 1 have one electron in their valence shells (1s1). So, the valency of all the alkali metals is \u20181\u2019.\nAs the elements present in a group have identical valence shell electronic configurations, they possess similar chemical properties.\nThe physical properties of the elements in a group such as melting point, boiling point and density vary gradually.\nThe atoms of the 'group 18' elements have stable electronic configuration in their valence shells and hence they are unreactive.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Anything which repeats itself after a regular interval is called periodic and this behaviour is called periodicity. Some of the atomic properties of the elements are periodic.\nProperties such as atomic radius, ionic radius, ionisation energy, electronegativity, electron affinity, show a regular periodicity and hence they are called periodic properties. The main significance of the modern periodic table is that it gives a clear understanding of the general properties and trends within a group or a period to predict with considerable accuracy, the properties of any element, even though that element may be unfamiliar to us. Let us discuss the periodic trend of some of the properties.\n8. 3. 1 Atomic Radius\nAtomic radius of an atom is defined as the distance between the centre of its nucleus and the outermost shell containing the valence electron. Direct measurement of the radius of an isolated atom is not possible. Except for noble gases, usually the atomic radius is referred to as covalent radius or metallic radius depending on the nature of the\n(a)Metallic Radius\n(b)Covalent Radius\nbonding between the concerned atoms. Atomic radius in metal atoms is known as metallic radius. It is defined as half the distance between the nuclei of adjacent metal atoms (Figure 8. 2a)).\nIn non - metallic elements, their atomic radius is known as Covalent radius. It is defined as half the distance between the nuclei of two covalently bonded atoms of the same element in a molecule (Figure 8. 2 (b)). For example, let us consider H2 molecule. The distance between the two hydrogen nuclei of the molecule is 0. 74 Angstrom. So its covalent radius is 0. 74 by 2 = 0. 37 Angstrom.\nWhen you look at the variation of the atomic radii in the periodic table, there are two distinct trends. Along the period, from left to right, the atomic radius of the elements decreases whereas along the groups, from the top to bottom, the atomic radius increases.\nFigure 8. 3 Atomic radius\nThe increase, down a group, is due to the increase in the valence shell number down the group. As the shell number increases, the distance between the valence shell and the nucleus increases. In contrast, when you observe along the period, the shell number remains the same but the number of protons (i. e. atomic number) increases. More and more positive charges impose a strong attraction over the electrons and thus the electron cloud shrinks towards the nucleus, which results in the decrease in the atomic size. Figure 8. 4 shows how the atomic radius decreases from lithium to boron.\nFigure 8. 4 Variation of atomic radius\n8. 3. 2 Ionic Radii\nIt is defined as the distance from the centre of the nucleus of the ion up to the point where it exerts its influence on the electron cloud of the ion.\nFigure 8. 5 Relative ionic radii of cation and anion\nYou know that ions are formed when an atom loss or gain electrons. When a neutral atom loses an electron, it becomes a positively charged ion called cation, whereas the gain of an electron by a neutral atom forms a negatively charged ion called anion. The size of the ions is important to determine their behaviours in Solutions and the structure of ionic solids. The size of a cation is always smaller than its corresponding neutral atom. But the anion is larger than its neutral atom.\nFor instance, lithium and sodium lose the single electron from their outermost energy level to form cations. The ions so formed are smaller because the remaining electrons are at inner cells and attracted more strongly by the nucleus. Fluorine and chlorine become negative ions by gaining an electron. When electrons are added, the charge on the nucleus is not great enough to hold the increased number of electrons as closely as it holds the electrons in the neutral atom. So, as seen in atomic radius, ionic radii also decrease along the period from left to right and increase down the group.\n8. 3. 3 Ionisation Energy\nIonisation energy is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from an isolated gaseous atom in its ground state to form a cation. It is otherwise called ionisation enthalpy. It is measured in kJ per mol. Higher the ionisation energy; it is more difficult to remove the electron.\nAs the atomic size decreases from left to right in a period, more energy is required to remove the electrons. So, the ionisation energy increases along the period. But, down the group, the atomic size increases and hence the valence electrons are loosely bound. They require relatively less energy for the removal. Thus, ionisation energy decreases down the group in the periodic table.\nNote: As the positive charge increases the size of the cation decreases as the negative charge increases the size of the anion increases\n8. 3. 4 Electron Affinity\nElectron affinity is the amount of energy released when an isolated gaseous atom gains an electron to form its anion. It is also measured in kJ per mol and represented by the following equation:\nA(g) + electron gives A(g) negative ion + Energy\nCl(g) + electron gives C l negative ion gaseous state + energy\nLike ionisation energy, electron affinity also increases from left to right in a period and decreases from top to bottom in a group.\nMore to Know\nNoble gases show no tendency to accept electrons because the outer s and p orbitals of noble gases are completely filled. No more electrons can be added to them and hence their electron affinities are zero.\n8. 3. 5 Electronegativity\nElectronegativity of an element is the measure of the tendency of its atom to attract the shared pair of electrons towards itself in a covalent bond. Let us consider HCl molecule. Both the hydrogen and chlorine atoms share one electron each to form the covalent bond between them. chlorine atom has a higher electronegativity and hence it pulls the shared electrons towards itself more strongly than hydrogen. Thus, when the bond breaks, the bonding electrons are left with chlorine forming Hpositive ion and C l negative ions. It is represented, diagrammatically, as shown below:\nFigure 8. 6 Relative electronegativity of H and Cl\nElectronegativity is based on various experimental data such as bond energy, ionization potential, electron affinity, etc. Pauling scale is the widely used scale to determine the electronegativity, which in turn predicts the nature of bonding (ionic or covalent) between the atoms in a molecule. Electronegativity of some of the elements are given below\nF = 4. 0, Cl = 3. 0, Br = 2. 8, I = 2. 5, H = 2. 1, Na = 1\nIf the difference in electronegativity between two elements is 1. 7, the bond has 50% ionic character and 50% covalent character.\nIf the difference is less than 1. 7, the bond is considered to be covalent.\nIf the difference is greater than 1. 7, the bond is considered to be more ionic.\nAlong the period, from left to right in the periodic table, the electronegativity increases because of the increase in the nuclear charge which in turn attracts the electrons more strongly. On moving down a group, the electronegativity of the elements decreases because of the increased number of valence shells.\nPeriodicProperty\nAtomic radius\nIonic radius\nIonisation energy\nElectron affinity\nElectro negativity\nTest yourself\nPredict the nature of the bond in the following molecules.\n1) NaCl (ii) NaBr (iii) NaI (iv) NaF (5) NaH\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

We use metals in our day - to - day activities. It is the utmost need to have some metals like sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, etc. in the human body. Deficiency of these metals affects the metabolic activities thereby causing diseases. So, metals play a vital role in our life. In this section, let us discuss how metals are obtained from various sources by the process of metallurgy.\nMetallurgy is a science of extracting metals from their ores and modifying the metals into alloys for various uses, based on their physical and chemical properties and their structural arrangement of atoms. A metallurgical process involve three main steps as follows:\n(i)Concentration or Separation of the ore: It is the process of removal of impurities from the ore.\n(ii)Production of the metal: It is the conversion of the ore into metal.\n(iii) Refining of the metal: It is the process of purification of the metal.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

If the gangue is acidic, then basic flux is added and vice versa.\nSlag: It is the fusible product formed when a flux reacts with a gangue during the extraction of metals.\nFlux + Gangue gives Slag\nSmelting: Smelting is the process of reducing the roasted metallic oxide from the metal in its molten condition. In this process, impurities are removed as slag by the addition of flux.\n8. 4. 2 Types of separation or concentration of an ore\nThere are four major types of separation of ores based on the nature of the ore. The different kinds of ores of metals are given in Table 8. 1\nConcentration of the crushed ore is done mainly by the following methods: -\n(i)Hydraulic (Gravity Separation) method\nPrinciple: The difference in the densities or specific gravities of the ore and the gangue is the main principle behind this method. Oxide ores are purified by this method. example Haematite F e2 O3 the ore of iron.\nNote: When the ore is heavier than the impurity, this method can be used.\nMethod: The ore is poured over a sloping, vibrating corrugated table with grooves and a jet of water is allowed to flow over it. The denser ore particles settle down in the grooves and lighter gangue particles are washed down by water.\n(ii) Magnetic separation method\nPrinciple: The magnetic properties of the ores form the basis of separation. When either the ore or the gangue is magnetic, this method is employed. e. g. , Tinstone S n O2, the ore of tin.\nFigure 8. 8 Magnetic separation\nMethod: The crushed ore is placed over a conveyer belt which rotates around two metal wheels, one of which is magnetic. The magnetic particles are attracted to the magnetic wheel and fall separately apart from the non - magnetic particles.\n(iii)Froth floatation\nPrinciple: This process depends on the preferential wettability of the ore with oil (pine oil) and the gangue particles by water. Lighter ores, such as sulphide ores, are concentrated by this method.\ne. g. , Zinc blende (Z n S).\nFigure 8. 9 Froth floatation\nNote: When the impurity is heavier than the ore this method can be used.\nMethod: The crushed ore is taken in a large tank containing pine oil and water and agitated with a current of compressed air. The ore is wetted by the oil and gets separated from the gangue in the form of froth. Since the ore is lighter, it comes on the surface with the froth and the impurities are left behind. e. g. , Zinc blende (ZnS).\n(iv) Chemical method or Leaching\nTable 8. 1 Types of ores\nCarbonate Ores\nHalide Ores\nSulphide Ores\nBauxite (A l2 O3. 2H2 O)\nMarble(Ca CO3)\nCryolite(Na3 A l F6)\nGalena(P b S)\nCuprite(Cu2 O)\nMannesite ((MgCO3)\nFluorspar(Ca F2)\nIron pyrite(Fe S2)\nHaematite (Fe2O3)\nSiderite (Fe CO3)\nRocksalt(NaCl)\nZinc blende(Z n S)\nMore to Know\nExtraction of metal from metal oxide can be categorized into three types\nMore reactive metals\nMedium reactive metals\nLess reactive metals\nNa, K, Ca, Mg, A l\nZ n, F e, Pb, Cu\nElectrolytic reduction of\nMetal oxide into metal\nChemical reduction of metal\nOxide into metal using coke\nThermal decomposition of\nMetal oxide into metal\nThis method is employed when the ore is in a very pure form.\nThe ore is treated with a suitable reagent such that the ore is soluble in it but the impurities are not. The impurities are removed by filtration. The Solution of the ore, ie. , the filtrate is treated with a suitable reagent which precipitates the ore. E. g. Bauxite Al2O3. 2H2O, the ore of aluminium.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Since it is a reactive metal, it occurs in the combined state. The important ores of aluminium are as follows\nOres of Aluminium\nA l2 O3. 2H2O\nBauxite is the chief ore of aluminium. The extraction of aluminium from bauxite involves two steps:\n(i)Conversion of bauxite into alumina\nBaeyer\u2019s Process:\nThe conversion of Bauxite into Alumina involves the following steps:\nBauxite ore is finely ground and heated under pressure with a Solution of concentrated caustic soda Solution at 150\u00b0 C to obtain sodium meta - aluminate.\nA l2 O3 + 2 NaOH gives 2 Na A l O2 + H2 O\nOn diluting sodium meta - aluminate with water, a precipitate of aluminium hydroxide is formed.\nNa A l O2 + 2 H2 O gives Al (O H) thrice + NaOH\nThe precipitate is filtered, washed, dried and ignited at 1000\u00b0C to get alumina.\n2 A l (O H) thriceunder goes at 1000 degree Celsius gives A l 2 O3 + 3 H2 O\n(ii) Electrolytic reduction of alumina\nHall\u2019s Process:\nAluminium is produced by the electrolytic reduction of fused alumina (A l 2 O3) in the electrolytic cell.\nCathode: Iron tank lined with graphite\nAnode: A bunch of graphite rods suspended in molten electrolyte.\nElectrolyte: Pure alumina + molten cryolite + fluorspar (fluorspar lowers the fusion temperature of electrolyte)\nTemperature: 900 - 950 \u00b0C\nVoltage used: 5 - 6 V\nOverall reaction: 2 Al2O3 \u2192 4 Al + 3 O2\u2191\nElectrolytic process of manufacturing aluminium\nFigure 8. 10 Hall's Process\nAluminium is deposited at the cathode and oxygen gas is liberated at the anode. Oxygen combines with graphite to form CO2.\nPhysical Properties of Aluminium\nIt is a silvery white metal\nIt has low density (2. 7) and it is light\nIt is malleable and ductile\nIt is a good conductor of heat and electricity.\nIts melting point is 660 \u00b0C.\nIt can be polished to produce a shiny attractive appearance.\nChemical Properties of Aluminium\nReaction with air: It is not affected by dry air. On heating at 800 \u00b0C, aluminium burns very brightly forming its oxide and nitride.\n4 A l + 3 O2 gives 2 A l 2 O3 (Aluminium oxide)\n2 A l + N2 gives 2 A l N (Aluminium nitride)\nReaction with water: Water does not react with aluminium due to the layer of oxide on it. When steam is passed over red - hot aluminium, hydrogen is produced.\n2A l + 3H2 O (steam) gives A l 2 O3 (aluminium oxide) + 3H2 gas\nreaction with alkalis: It reacts with strongcaustic alkalis forming aluminates.\n2 A l + 2NaOH + 2H2 O gives 2NaA l O2 (Sodium meta - aluminate) + 3H2 gas\nReaction with acids: With dilute andcon. HCl, it liberates H2gas.\n2A l + 6 H C l gives 2 A l C l3(Aluminiumchloride) + 3H2 gas\nAluminium liberates hydrogen on reaction with dilute sulphuric acid. Sulphur dioxide is liberated with hot concentrated sulphuric acid\n2A l + 3H2 S O4 gives A l 2 (S O4) thrice + 3H2 gas\n2A l + 6H2 S O4 gives A l2 (S O4)thrice + 6H2 O + 3 S O2 gas\nMore to Know\nDilute or concentrated nitric acid does not attack aluminium, but it renders aluminium passive due to the formation of an oxide film on its surface.\nAs reducing agent: Aluminium is apowerful reducing agent.

Copper is found in the native state as well as combined state.\nOres of copper\nCopperpyrites\nCuprite or ruby copper\nCopper glance\nThe chief ore of copper is copper pyrite. It yields nearly 76% of the world production of copper. Extraction of copper from copper pyrites involves the following steps\ni. Concentration of ore: The ore is crushed and concentrated by froth floatation process.\nii. Roasting: The concentrated ore is roasted in excess of air. During the process of roasting, the moisture and volatile impurities are removed. Sulphur, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony are removed as oxides. Copper pyrite is partly converted into sulphides of copper and iron.\n2 CuF e S 2 + O2 gives Cu2S + 2 F e S + S O2 gas.\niii. Smelting: The roasted ore is mixed with powdered coke and sand and is heated in a blast furnace to obtain matte (Cu2 S + F e S) and slag. The slag is removed as waste.\niv. Bessemerisation: The molten matte is transferred to Bessemer converter in order to obtain blister copper. Ferrous sulphide from matte is oxidized to ferrous oxide, which is removed as slag using silica.\n2 F e S + 3 O2 gives 2 F e O + 2 S O2 gas\nF e O + S i O2 gives F e S I O 3 (slag) (Iron silicate)\n2 Cu2 S + 3O2 gives 2 Cu2 O + 2 S O2 gas\n2 Cu2 O + Cu2 S gives 6 Cu + S O2 gas (Blister copper)\nv. Refining: Blister copper contains 98% of pure copper and 2% of impurities and is purified by electrolytic refining. This method is used to get metal of a high degree of purity. For electrolytic refining of copper, we use:\nCathode: A thin plate of pure copper metal.\nAnode: A block of impure copper metal.\nElectrolyte: Copper sulphate Solution acidified with sulphuric acid.\nWhen electric current is passed through the electrolytic Solution, pure copper gets deposited at the cathode and the impurities settle at the bottom of the anode in the form of sludge called anode mud.\nPhysical Properties of Copper\nCopper is a reddish - brown metal, with high lustre, high density and high melting point (1356\u00b0C).\nChemical Properties of Copper\n1. Action of Air and Moisture: Copper gets covered with a green layer of basic copper carbonate in the presence of C O2 and moisture.\n2Cu + O2 + C O2 + H2O gives Cu C O3. Cu (O H)twice.\n2. Action of Heat: On heating at different temperatures in the presence of oxygen, copper forms two types of oxides Cu O, Cu2 O\n2 Cu + O2when heated below 1370 kelvin it gives2 CuO Copper II oxide (black)\n4 Cu + O2 when heated above 1370 kelvin it gives 2Cu2 O Copper one oxide (red)\n3. Action of Acids:\na) With dilute HCl and dilute H2 S O4:\nDilute acids such as HCl and H2 S O4 have no action on these metals in the absence of air. Copper dissolves in these acids in the presence of air.\n2Cu + 4HCl + O2(air) gives 2CuCl2 + 2H2O\nb) With dil. HNO3:\nCopper reacts with dil. HNO3 with the liberation of Nitric Oxide gas\n3Cu + 8HNO3 givesCu (N O3)twice + 2N O gas + 4H2O\n4. Action of Chlorine:\nChlorine reacts with copper, resulting in theformation of copper (II) chloride.\nCu + Cl2 gives Cu Cl2\n5. Action of Alkalis:\nCopper is not attackedby alkalis.\nUses of Copper:\ni. It is extensively used in manufacturing electric cables and other electric appliances.\nii. It is used for making utensils, containers, calorimeters and coins,\niii. It is used in electroplating.\niv. It is alloyed with gold and silver for making coins and jewels\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

It occurs in nature as oxides, sulphides and carbonates. The ores of iron are as follows:\nOres of iron\nIron pyrite\nIron is chiefly extracted from haematite ore (F e2O3)\n1. Concentration by Gravity Separation: The powdered ore is washed with a steam of water. As a result, the lighter sand particles and other impurities are washed away and the heavier ore particles settle down.\n2. Roasting and Calcination: The concentrated ore is strongly heated in a limited supply of air in a reverberatory furnace. As a result, moisture is driven out and sulphur, arsenic and phosphorus impurities are oxidized off.\n3. Smelting (in a Blast Furnace): The charge consisting of roasted ore, coke and limestone in the ratio 8: 4: 1 is smelted in a blast furnace by introducing it through the hopper arrangement at the top. There are three important regions in the furnace.\nFigure 8. 11 Blast Furnace\n(a)The Lower Region (Combustion Zone) - The temperature is at 1500\u00b0C. In this region, coke burns with oxygen to form C O2 when the charge comes in contact with a hot blast of air.\nC + O2when heated at 1500 degree Celsius it gives C O2 + Heat\nIt is an exothermic reaction since heat is liberated.\n(b) The Middle Region (Fusion Zone) \u2013 The temperature prevails at 1000\u00b0C. In this region, C O2 is reduced to C O.\nCO2 + C when heated at 1000 degree Celsius it gives2 CO - HEAT\nLimestone decomposes to calcium oxide and C O2.\nC a C O3when heated at 1000 degree Celsius it gives C a O + C O2 - HEAT\nThese two reactions are endothermic due to absorption of heat. Calcium oxide combines with silica to form calcium silicate slag.\nC a O + S I O2 gives C a S I O3\n(c) The Upper Region (Reduction Zone) - The temperature prevails at 400\u00b0C In this region carbon monoxide reduces ferric oxide to form a fairly pure spongy iron.\nF e2 O3 + 3C O when heated at 400 degree Celsius it gives 2F e + 3C O2 gas\nThe molten iron is collected at the bottom of the furnace after removing the slag.\nThe iron thus formed is called pig iron. It is remelted and cast into different moulds. This iron is called cast iron.\nPhysical properties:\n1. It is a lustrous metal, greyish white in colour.\nii. It has high tensility, malleability and ductility.\niii. It can be magnetized.\nChemical properties:\n1. Reaction with air or oxygen: Only onheating in air, iron formsmagnetic oxide.\n3 F e + 2 O2 gives F e 3 O4 BLACK\nii. Reaction with moist air: When iron is exposed to moist air, it forms a layer of brown hydrated ferric oxide on its surface. This compound is known as rust and the phenomenon of formation of rust is known as rusting.\n4 F e + 3 O2 + x H2 O gives 2 F e 2 O3. x H2 O (rust)\niii. Reaction with steam: When steam is passed over red - hot iron, magnetic oxide is formed.\n3 F e + 4 H2 O (STEAM) gives F e 3 O4 + 4 H2 gas\niv. Reaction with chlorine: Iron combines with chlorine to form ferric chloride.\n2 F e + 3 C l 2 gives 2 F e C l3(ferricchloride)\n5. Reaction with acids: With dilute HCl and dilute H2 S O4 it liberates H2 gas.\nF e + 2 HCl gives F e Cl2 + H2 gas\nF e + H2 S O4 gives F e S O4 + H2 gas\nWith dilute HNO3 in cold condition it gives ferrous nitrate and ammonium nitrate.\n4F e + 10HNO3 gives4F e (N O3) twice + NH4N O3 + 3 H2O\nWith con. H2 S O4 it forms ferric sulphate and liberates S O2.\n2F e + 6H2S O4 givesFe2(S O4) thrice + 3S O2 + 6H2O\nWhen iron is dipped in concentrated H N O3 it becomes chemically passive or inert due to the formation of a layer of iron oxide (F e 3 O4) on its surface.\nUses of iron\nPig iron(Iron with 2 - 4. 5% of carbon): It is used in making pipes, stoves, radiators, railings, manhole covers and drain pipes.\nSteel(Iron with less than 0. 25% of carbon): It is used in the construction of buildings, machinery, transmission cables and T. V towers and in making alloys.\nWrought iron(Iron with 0. 25 - 2% of wrought carbon): It is used in making springs, anchors and electromagnets.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Pure gold is brittle to be used. The addition of small percentage of copper enhances its strength and utility.\nAn amalgam is an alloy of mercury with another metal. These alloys are formed through metallic bonding with the electrostatic force of attraction between the electrons and the positively charged metal ions. Silver tin amalgam is used for dental filling.\nReasons for alloying:\nTo modify appearance and colour\nTo modify chemical activity.\nTo lower the melting point.\nTo increase hardness and tensile strength.\nTo increase resistance to electricity.\nMethod of making alloys\n(a)By fusing the metals together. example Brass is made by melting zinc and copper.\n(b)By compressing finely divided metals.\nExample Wood metal: an alloy of lead, tin, bismuth and cadmium powder is a fusible alloy.\nAlloys as solid Solutions:\nAlloys can be considered solid Solutions in which the metal with high concentration is solvent and other metals are solute.\nFor example, brass is a solid Solution of zinc (solute) in copper (solvent).\nTypes of Alloys\nBased on the presence or absence of Iron, alloys can be classified into:\nFerrous alloys: Contain Iron as a major component. A few examples of ferrous alloys are Stainless Steel, Nickel Steel etc.\nNon - ferrous alloys: These alloys do not contain Iron as a major component.

Most of the substances that we encounter in our daily life are mixtures of two or more substances. The substances present in a mixture may exist in one or more physical state. For example, when we burn wood, the smoke released is a mixture of solid carbon and gases like C O2, C O, etc.\nIn some cases of mixtures, their components can be separated easily whereas in some other cases they cannot be. Consider the two mixtures, one which contains salt and water, and the another which contains sand and water. Water is the one of the components in both the mixtures. In the first case salt dissolves in water. In the second case the sand does not dissolve in water. Sand in water can be separated by filtration but salt cannot be separated as it dissolves in water to form a homogeneous mixture. This kind of homogenous mixtures are termed as \u201cSolutions\u201d.\nFigure 9. 1 Homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

We cannot imagine life on earth without sea water. It is a mixture of many dissolved salts. Another one is air. It is a mixture of gases like nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and other gases.\nAll the life forms on the earth are associated with Solutions. Plants take Solutions of nutrients for their growth from the soil. Most of the liquids found in human body including blood, lymph and urine are Solutions. Day to day human activities like washing, cooking, cleaning and few other activities involve the formation of Solutions with water. Similarly, the drinks what we take, like fruit juice, aerated drinks, tea, coffee etc. are also Solutions.

In a Solution, the component which is present in lesser amount (by weight), is called solute and the component, which is present in a larger amount (by weight) is called solvent. The solute gets distributed uniformly throughout the solvent and thus forming the mixture homogeneous. So, the solvent acts as a dissolving medium in a Solution. The process of uniform distribution of solute into solvent is called disSolution. Figure 9. 2 shows the schematic representation of Solution.\nA Solution must at least be consisting of two components (a solute and a solvent). Such Solutions which are made of one solute and one solvent (two components) are called binary Solutions. e. g. On adding copper sulphate crystals to water, it dissolves in water forming a Solution of copper sulphate as shown in Figure 9. 3. It contains two components i. e. one solute - copper sulphate and one solvent - water So it is a binary Solution. Similarly, a Solution may contain more than two components. For example if salt and sugar are added to water, both dissolve in water forming a Solution. Here two solutes are dissolved in one solvent. Such kind of Solutions which contain three components are called ternary Solutions.\nFigure 9. 3 Formation of Copper sulphate Solution\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

That is why, water is called as \u2018Universal solvent\u201d. However some substances do not dissolve in water. Therefore, other solvents such as ethers, benzene, alcohols etc. , are used to prepare a Solution. On the basis of type of solvent, Solutions are classified into two types. They are aqueous Solutions and non - aqueous Solutions.\na) Aqueous Solution:\nThe Solution in which water acts as a solvent is called aqueous Solution. Example Common salt in water, Sugar in water, Copper sulphate in water etc. .\nb) Non\u2013Aqueous Solution:\nThe Solution in which any liquid, other than water, acts as a solvent is called nonaqueous Solution. Solvent other than water is referred to as non - aqueous solvent. Generally, alcohols, benzene, ethers, carbon disulphide, acetone, etc. are used as non - aqueous solvents. Examples for non - aqueous Solutions: Sulphur dissolved in carbon disulphide; Iodine dissolved in carbon tetrachloride.\nFigure9. 4 Sulphur is soluble in carbon - di - sulphide, Sulphur is Insoluble in water\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

Based on the amount of solute, in the given amount of solvent, Solutions are classified into the following types:\n(i) Saturated Solution\n(ii) Unsaturated Solution\n(iii) Supersaturated Solution\n(i) Saturated Solution: A Solution in which no more solute can be dissolved in a definite amount of the solvent at a given temperature is called saturated Solution. Example 36 gram of sodium chloride in 100 gram of water at 25 degree Celcius forms saturated Solution. Further addition of sodium chloride, leave it undissolved.\n(ii) Unsaturated Solution: Unsaturated Solution is one that contains less solute than that of the saturated Solution at a given temperature. Example 10 gram or 20 gram or 30 gram of Sodium chloride in 100 gram of water at 25 degree Celcius forms an unsaturated Solution.\n(iii) Super saturated Solution: Supersaturated Solution is one that contains more solute than the saturated Solution at a given temperature. Example 40 gram of sodium chloride in 100 gram of water at 25 degree Celcius forms super saturated Solution. This state can be achieved by altering any other conditions like temperature, pressure. Super saturated Solutions are unstable, and the solute is reappearing as crystals when the Solution is disturbed.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

It expresses the relative concentration of two Solutions with respect to their solutes present in the given amount of the solvent. For example, you are given two cups of tea. When you taste them, you feel that one is sweeter than the other. What do you infer from it? The tea which sweet more contains higher amount of sugar than the other. How can you express your observation? You can say that the tea is stronger. But a chemist would say that it is \u2018concentrated\u2019. When we compare two Solutions having same solute and solvent the one which contains higher amount of solute per the given amount of solvent is said to be \u2018concentratedSolution\u2019 and the another is said to be \u2018dilute Solution\u2019. They are schematically represented by Figure9. 5.\nFigure9. 5 Dilute and Concentrated Solution\nDifferentiating Solutions as dilute and concentrated is a qualitative representation. It does not imply the quantity of the solute. This difference is observed by means of some physical characteristics such as colour, density, etc. .\nLook at the following pictures. Label them as dilute and concentrated Solution and justify your answer.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

When this limit is reached, we have a saturated Solution and any excess solute that is added, simply resides at the bottom of the Solution. The extent of disSolution of a solute in a solvent can be better explained by its solubility. Solubility is a measure of how much of a solute can be dissolved in a specified amount of a solvent.\nSolubility is defined as the number of grams of a solute that can be dissolved in 100 gram of a solvent to form its saturated Solution at a given temperature and pressure. For example, 36 gram of sodium chloride need to be dissolved in 100 gram of water to form its saturated Solution at 25 degree Celcius Thus the solubility of sodium chloride in water is 36 gram at 25 degree Celcius. The solubility is mathematically expressed as\nSolubility = mass of the solute multiplied by 100 / mass of the solvent.\nTable 9. 2 Solubility\u2019s of some common substances in water at 25 degree Celcius\nName ofthesolute\nFormula of the solute\nSolubility gram per 100 gram water\nCalcium carbonate\nC a C O3 (solid)\nSodium chloride\nNaCl(solid)\nSodium hydroxide\nNaOH(solid)\nC6H12O6(solid)\nSodium bromide\nNaBr (solid)\nSodium iodide\nNa I (solid)\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

They are:\n(i) Nature of the solute and solvent\n(ii) Temperature\n(iii) Pressure\n(i) Nature of the solute and solvent\nThe nature of the solute and solvent plays an important role in solubility. Although water dissolves an enormous variety of substances, both ionic and covalent, it does not dissolve everything. The phrase that scientists often use when predicting solubility is \u201clike dissolves like. \u201d This expression means that dissolving occurs when similarities exist between the solvent and the solute. For example: Common salt is a polar compound and dissolves readily in polar solvent like water. Non - polar compounds are soluble in non - polar solvents. For example, Fat dissolved in ether. But non - polar compounds, do not dissolve in polar solvents; polar compounds do not dissolve in non - polar solvents.\nii. Effect of Temperature\nSolubility of Solids in Liquid: Generally, solubility of a solid solute in a liquid solvent increase with increase in temperature. For example, a greater amount of sugar will dissolve in warm water than in cold water. In endothermic process, solubility increases with increase in temperature. In exothermic process, solubility decreases with increase in temperature.\nSolubility of Gases in liquid Do you know why is it bubbling when water is boiled? Solubility of gases in liquid decrease with increase in temperature. Generally, water contains dissolved oxygen. When water is boiled, the solubility of oxygen in water decreases, so oxygen escapes in the form of bubbles. Aquatic animals live more in cold regions because, more amount of dissolved oxygen is present in the water of cold regions. This shows that the solubility of oxygen in water is more at low temperatures.\nEffect of Pressure\nEffect of pressure is observed only in the case of solubility of a gas in a liquid. When the pressure is increased, the solubility of a gas in liquid increases. The common examples for solubility of gases in liquids are carbonated beverages, That is soft drinks, household cleaners containing aqueous Solution of ammonia, formalin - aqueous Solution of formaldehyde, etc. .\nFigure9. 6 Effect of pressure on solubility\nMore to know\nThe effect of pressure on the solubility of a gas in liquid is given by Henry\u2019s law. It states that, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas over the Solution at a definite temperature.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A context-aware student opener mentioning the specific topic title.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 1 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 1, in one of the three specified formats.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 1 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 2 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 2, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 2 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 3 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 3, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 3 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 4 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 4, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 4 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Short transition phrase for the next question.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<MCQ 5 with options A, B, C, D>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<Student's answer to MCQ 5, in a different format.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<Encouraging feedback 5 + explanation of the correct answer.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"<A natural student phrase to end the entire quiz session.>\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"<A final, encouraging sign-off from KalviMate.>\"\n  }\n]"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}

This process is called hydration. These ionic substances crystallize out from their saturated aqueous Solution with a definite number of molecules of water. The numberof water molecules found in the crystalline substance is called water of crystallization. Such salts are called hydrated salts.\nOn heating these hydrated crystalline salts, they lose their water of crystallization and become amorphous or lose their colour(if they are coloured).
