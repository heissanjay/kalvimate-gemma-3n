He stated that a moving body naturally comes to rest without any external influence of the force. Such motions are termed as ‘natural motion’ (Force independent). He also proposed that a force (a push or a pull) is needed to make the bodies to move from their natural state (rest) and behave contrary to their own natural state called as ‘violent motion’ (Force dependent). Further, he said, when two different mass bodies are dropped from a height, the heavier body falls faster than the lighter one.",
