The vibrating bodies produce energy in the form of waves, which are nothing but sound waves (Figure 5.1). Suppose you and your friend are on the Moon. Will you be able to hear any sound produced by your friend? As the Moon does not have air, you will not be able to hear any sound produced by your friend. Hence, you understand that the sound produced due to the vibration of different bodies needs a material medium like air, water, steel, etcetera, for its propagation. Hence, sound can propagate through a gaseous medium or a liquid medium or a solid medium.",
