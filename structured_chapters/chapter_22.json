The use of natural resources in excess and unplanned way leads to imbalance in the environment. A judicious balance should be maintained between exploitation of resources and its replenishment. Proper utilization and management of nature and its resources is termed as conservation.",
                "We have to build a sustainable world, which should last forever. Some of the ways to sustain continuous use of resources are practices to utilise energy efficiently, avoid wastage of water, avoid usage of plastics and other non- biodegradable materials and to take care for the environment we live. It is important that we manage and use our resources carefully so as to preserve for the future generations."
