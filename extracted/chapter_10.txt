       INTRODUCTION 
As you know from your earlier studies, 
a chemical reaction involves breaking of old 
chemical bonds and formation of new chemical 
bonds. This change may happen spontaneously or 
it may be facilitated by external forces or energy. 
Chemistry is all about chemical reactions. In your 
day to day life, you could observe many chemical 
reactions. A clear understanding of these reactions 
is essential in order to manipulate them for the 
sake of human life and environment. So, chemistry 
mainly focuses on chemical reactions.  Let us try 
to find the answer for the following questions:
 
 You need energy to play, walk, run or to 
perform various physical activities. Where 
do you get the energy from?
 
 How do plants grow and get their food?
 
 How does a car move using fuel?
 
 Why does iron rust on its exposure to 
water or air?
You get energy from the digestion of 
the food you eat. Plants grow by absorbing 
nutrients from the Earth and get their food by 
photosynthesis. The combustion of a fuel makes 
the car to move. Oxidation of iron causes rusting. 
So, all these processes are chemical changes 
i.e. the materials, which undergo changes are 
converted into some other new materials. For 
example, by burning petrol, the hydrocarbons 
present in it are converted into carbon dioxide 
and water. In this chapter, let us discuss the 
nature and types of chemical reactions.

equal in the given equation. On balancing the 
number of atoms, the following equation can 
be obtained:
CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O
Further, the chemical equation provides 
information on the physical state of the 
substances and the conditions under which the 
reaction takes place.
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)

A balanced chemical equation 
is the simplified representation of a 
chemical reaction which describes the 
chemical composition, physical state of 
the reactants and the products, and the 
reaction conditions.
What happens during a chemical 
reaction?
 
 In a chemical reaction, the atoms of 
the reacting molecules or elements are 
rearranged to form new molecules. 
 
 Old chemical bonds between atoms are 
broken and new chemical bonds are 
formed.
 
 Bond breaking absorbs energy whereas 
bond formation releases energy
How are chemical reactions 
represented?
When methane reacts with oxygen, it 
forms carbon dioxide and water. How can you 
represent this reaction? It can be written as a 
word equation as shown below:
Methane + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water
But, this equation does not give the 
chemical composition of the reactants and 
products. So, to learn the characteristics of 
a chemical reaction, it is represented by a 
chemical equation. In the chemical equation, 
the chemicals of the reaction are represented 
by their chemical formulas.The compounds or 
elements, which undergo reactions (reactants) 
are shown to the left of an arrow and the 
compounds formed (products) are shown to 
the right of the arrow. The arrow indicates the 
direction of the reaction. Thus, the aforesaid 
reaction can be written as follows:
CH4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O
But, this is also an incomplete chemical 
equation. Because, the law of conservation of 
matter states that matter cannot be created 
or destroyed. You cannot create new atoms 
by a chemical reaction. In contrast, they are 
rearranged in different ways by a chemical 
reaction to form a new compound. So, in a 
chemical equation, the number of atoms of 
the reactants and that of the products must be 
equal. The number of hydrogen and oxygen 
atoms in the reactants and the products are not

The phases or the physical state of 
the substances in a chemical reaction are 
denoted in short form within a bracket, 
as the subscript of the formula, of the 
respective substances. For example, when 
solid potassium reacts with liquid water, 
it produces hydrogen gas and potassium 
hydroxide solution. All these information 
of the reaction is given in the chemical 
equation as shown below:

Types of Chemical Reactions
 10.1   TYPES OF CHEMICAL 
REACTIONS
Classification based on the nature 
of rearrangements of atoms
So 
far 
you 
studied 
about a chemical reaction 
and how it can be described 
as a chemical equation. A 
large number of chemical 
reactions are taking place 
around us every day.Are they taking place 
in a similar way? No. Each reaction involves 
different kinds of atoms and hence the way 
they react also differs. Thus, based on the 
manner by which the atoms of the reactants are 
rearranged, chemical reactions are classified as 
follows.
(a) Combination reactions
A combination reaction is a reaction in 
which two or more reactants combine to form 
a compound. It is otherwise called 'synthesis 
reaction' or 'composition reaction'. When 
a reactant ‘A’ combines with ‘B’, it forms the 
product ‘AB’.  The generalised scheme of a 
combination reaction is given below: 
A  + 
B  → A
B
Example: Hydrogen gas combines with 
chlorine gas to form hydrogen chloride gas.
H2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2HCl(g)
Depending on the chemical nature 
of the reactants, there are three classes of 
combination reactions:
 Element + Element → Compound
In this type of combination reaction, 
two elements react with one other to form 
a compound. The reaction may take place 
between a metal and a non-metal or two 
non-metals.
Example 1: When solid sulphur reacts 
with oxygen, it produces sulphur dioxide. Here 
both the reactants are non-metals.
+
 
S(s) 
+ 
O2(g) 
→ 
SO2(g)
Example 2: Sodium, a silvery-white 
metal, combines with chlorine, a pale yellow 
green gas, to form sodium chloride, an edible 
compound. Here one of the reactants is a metal 
(sodium) and the other (chlorine) is a non-
metal.
2Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2NaCl(s)
Test Yourself: 
Identify 
the 
possible 
combination 
reactions between the metals and non-metals 
given in the following table and write their 
balanced chemical equations:
Metals
Non-metals
Na, K, Cs, Ca, Mg
F, Cl, Br, I
 Compound + Element → Compound
In this case, a compound reacts with an 
element to form a new compound. For instance, 
phosphorous trichloride reacts with chlorine 
gas and forms phosphorous pentachloride.
PCl3(I) + Cl2(g) → PCl5(s)
 Compound + Compound → Compound
It is a reaction between two compounds 
to form a new compound. In the following 
reaction, silicon dioxide reacts with calcium 
oxide to form calcium silicate.
SiO2(s) + CaO(s) → CaSiO3(s)
Most of the combination reactions are 
exothermic in nature. Because, they involve 
the formation of new bonds, which releases 
a huge amount of energy in the form of 
heat.

(b) Decomposition reactions
In a decomposition reaction, a single 
compound splits into two or more simpler 
substances under suitable conditions. It is 
the opposite of the combination reaction. 
The generalised scheme of a decomposition 
reaction is given below: 
Breaking 
of 
bonds 
is 
the 
major 
phenomenon in a decomposition reaction and 
hence it requires energy to break the bonds, 
depending on the nature of the energy used in 
the decomposition reaction. 
There 
are 
three 
main 
classes 
of 
decomposition reactions. They are
(i) 
Thermal Decomposition Reactions
(ii) Electrolytic Decomposition Reactions
(iii) Photo Decomposition Reactions
A solution of slaked lime 
is used for white washing 
walls. 
Calcium 
hydroxide 
reacts slowly with the carbon 
dioxide in air to form a thin layer of 
calcium carbonate on the walls. Calcium 
carbonate is formed after two to three days 
of white washing and gives a shiny finish 
to the walls. It is interesting to note that 
the chemical formula for marble is also 
CaCO3
Ca(OH)2(aq) + CO2(g) → CaCO3(s) + H2O(I)
Slaked
Lime
Carbon
dioxide
Calcium
Carbonate
Water
(i) Thermal Decomposition Reactions
In this type of reaction, the reactant is 
decomposed by applying heat. For example, on 
heating mercury (II) oxide is decomposed into 
mercury metal and oxygen gas. As the molecule 
is dissociated by the absorption of heat, it is 
otherwise called ‘Thermolysis’. It is a class of 
compound to element/element decomposition. 
i.e. a compound (HgO) is decomposed into 
two elements (Hg and Oxygen).
2HgO(s) 
Heat
→ 2Hg(l) + O2(g)
Similarly, when calcium carbonate is 
heated, it breaks down in to calcium oxide and 
carbon dioxide. It is a type of compound to 
compound/compound decomposition.
CaCO3(s) 
Heat
→ CaO(s) + CO2(g)
In 
thermal 
decomposition 
reaction, 
heat is supplied to break the bonds. Such 
reactions, in which heat is absorbed, are called 
‘Endothermic reactions’.
(ii) Electrolytic Decomposition Reactions
In some of the decomposition reactions, 
electrical energy is used to bring about the 
reaction. For example, decomposition of sodium 
chloride occurs on passing electric current 
through its aqueous solution. Sodium chloride 
decomposes in to metallic sodium and chlorine 
gas. This process is termed as ‘Electrolysis’. 
2NaCl(aq)  
 2Na(s) + Cl2(g)
Here, a compound (NaCl) is converted into 
elements (Na and chlorine). So it is a type of 
compound to element/element decomposition.
(iii) Photo Decomposition Reactions
Light is an another form of energy, 
which facilitates some of the decomposition 
reactions. For example, when silver bromide 
is exposed to light, it breaks down into silver 
metal and bromine gas. As the decomposition 
is caused by light, this kind of reaction is also 
called ‘Photolysis’. 
2AgBr(s)  → 2Ag(s) + Br2(g)

Types of Chemical Reactions
The yellow coloured silver bromide 
turns into grey coloured silver metal. It 
is also a compound to element/element 
decomposition.
(c) Single Displacement Reactions
It is a reaction between an element 
and a compound. When they react, one of 
the elements of the compound-reactant is 
replaced by the element-reactant to form 
a new compound and an element. The 
general schematic representation of a single 
displacement reaction is given as: 
‘A’ displaces element ‘B’ from the 
compound 
‘BC’ 
and 
hence 
a 
single 
displacement reaction occurs. If zinc metal is 
placed in hydrochloric acid, hydrogen gas is 
evolved. Here, hydrogen is displaced by zinc 
metal and zinc chloride is formed.
Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl2(aq) + H2(g)
Fe(s) + CuSO4(aq) → FeSO4(aq) + Cu(s)
If an iron nail is placed in an aqueous 
solution of copper (II) sulphate as shown in 
Fig. 10.2, the iron displaces copper from its 
aqueous solution and the so formed copper 
deposits over  the iron nail.
Figure 10.2 Displacement of copper 
It is easy to propose so many reactions 
of this kind with different combinations of 
reactants. Will they all occur in practice? 
No. This is most easily demonstrated with 
halogens. Let us consider the following two 
reactions: 
2NaCl(aq) + F2(g) → 2NaF(aq) + Cl2(g)
2NaF(aq) + Cl2(g) → 2NaCl(aq) + F2(g)
The first reaction involves the displacement 
of chlorine from NaCl, by fluorine. In the 
second reaction, chlorine displaces fluorine 
from NaF. Out of these two, the second 
reaction will not occur. Because, fluorine is 
more active than chlorine and occupies the 
upper position in the periodic table. So, in 
displacement reactions, the activity of the 
elements and their relative position in the 
periodic table are the key factors to determine 
the feasibility of the reactions. More active 
elements readily displace less active elements 
from their aqueous solution.
The activity series of some elements is 
given below:

(d) Double Displacement Reactions
When two compounds react, if their ions 
are interchanged, then the reaction is called 
double displacement reaction. The ion of 
one compound is replaced by the ion of the 
another compound. Ions of identical charges 
are only interchanged, i.e., a cation can be 
replaced by other cations. This reaction is also 
called ‘Metathesis Reaction’. The schematic 
representation of a double displacement 
reaction is given below:

In a double displacement reaction 
either one of the products must be either 
a precipitate or water. By this way, there 
are major classes of double displacement 
reactions. They are:
(i) 
Precipitation Reactions
(ii) Neutralization Reactions
(i) Precipitation Reactions
When 
aqueous 
solutions 
of 
two 
compounds are mixed, if they react to form an 
insoluble compound and a soluble compound, 
then it is called precipitation reaction. Because 
the insoluble compound, formed as one of 
the products, is a precipitate and hence the 
reaction is so called.
When the clear aqueous solutions of 
potassium iodide and lead (II) nitrate are 
mixed, a double displacement reaction takes 
place between them. 
Pb(NO3)2(aq) + 2KI(aq) → PbI2(s)↓ + 2KNO3(aq)
Potassium and lead displace or replace 
one other and form a yellow precipitate of lead 
(II) iodide as shown in Fig. 10.3.

the acid reacts with the base to form a salt and

Reaction of sodium hydroxide with 
hydrochloric acid is a typical neutralization 
reaction. Here, sodium replaces hydrogen from 
hydrochloric acid forming sodium chloride, a 
neutral soluble salt.
NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)
Similarly, when ammonium hydroxide 
reacts with nitric acid, it forms ammonium 
nitrate and water.
HNO3(aq) + NH4OH(aq) → NH4NO3(aq) + H2O(l)
(e) Combustion Reactions
A combustion reaction is one in which 
the reactant rapidly combines with oxygen to 
form one or more oxides and energy (heat). So 
in combustion reactions, one of the reactants 
must be oxygen. Combustion reactions are 
majorly used as heat energy sources in many 
of our day to day activities. For instance, we 
use LPG gas for domestic cooking purposes. 
We get heat and flame from LPG gas by its 
combustion reaction of its constituent gases. 
LPG is a mixture of hydrocarbon gases like 
propane, butane, propylene, etc. All these 
hydrocarbons burn with oxygen to form 
carbon dioxide and water. 
C3H8(g) + 5O2(g) → 3CO2(g) + 4H2O(g) + Heat
Since heat is evolved, it is an exothermic 
reaction. As oxygen is added, it is also an 
oxidation. So, combustion may be called as an 
Propane
exothermic oxidation. If a flame is formed (as 
shown in Fig. 10.4), then it is called burning.
Figure 10.4 Combustion of LPG gas 
Which of the following is a combustion?
(i) 
Digestion of Food  
(ii) Rusting of iron 
Many thousands of reactions fall under 
these five categories and further you will learn 
in detail about these reactions in your higher 
classes. 
10.1.2  Classification based 
on the direction of the 
reaction
You know that innumerable changes 
occur every day around us. Are all they 
permanent? For example, liquid water freezes 
into ice, but then ice melts into liquid water. In 
other words, freezing is reversed. So, it is not 
a permanent change. Moreover, it is a physical 
change. Physical changes can be reversed 
easily. Can chemical changes be reversed? 
Can the products be converted into reactants? 
Let us consider the burning of a wood. The 
carbon compounds present in the wood are 
burnt into carbon dioxide gas and water. 
Can we get back the wood immediately from 
carbon dioxide and water? We cannot. So, it is 
a permanent change.  In most of the cases, we 
cannot. But, some chemical reactions can be 
reversed. Our mobile phone gets energy from 
its lithium ion battery by chemical reactions. 
It is called discharging. On recharging the 
mobile, these chemical reactions are reversed. 
Thus, chemical reactions may be reversed 
under suitable conditions. Hence, they are 
10th_Science_Unit-10.indd   143
12/3/2022   2:55:20 PM


144
10th Standard Science
grouped into two categories such as reversible 
and irreversible reactions.  
Figure 10.5 Burning of wood and recharging 
of mobile battery 
Reversible Reactions 
A reversible reaction is a reaction in 
which the products can be converted back 
to the reactants. A reversible reaction is 
represented by a double arrow with their heads 
in the direction opposite to each other. Thus, a 
reversible reaction can be represented by the 
following equation:
Explanation: Here, the compound ‘AB’ 
undergoes decomposition to form the products 
‘A’ and ‘B’. It is the forward reaction. As soon as 
the products are formed, they combine together 
to form ‘AB’. It is the backward reaction. So, 
the reaction takes place in both the directions. 
Do you think then that no products are formed 
in the aforesaid reaction? If you think so, you 
are wrong. Because, even though the reaction 
takes place in both the directions, at the initial 
stage the rates (speed) of these reactions are not 
equal. Consider the following decomposition 
reaction of phosphorous pentachloride into 
phosphorous trichloride and chlorine. 
PCl5(g) 
 PCl3(g) + Cl2(g)
The forward reaction is the decomposition 
of PCl5 and the backward reaction is the 
combination of PCl3 and Cl2. Initially, the 
forward reaction proceeds faster than the 
backward reaction. After sometimes, the 
speed of both the reactions become equal. 
So, PCl5 cannot be completely converted into 
the products as the reaction is reversed. It is a 
reversible reaction. The actual measurements 
of the given reaction show that the reaction is 
at equilibrium, but the amount of PCl5 is more 
than that of PCl3 and Cl2.
MORE TO KNOW
If hydrogen peroxide is poured on a wound, 
it decomposes into water and oxygen. The 
gaseous oxygen bubbles away as it is formed 
and thus prevent the formation of H2O2. 
Hydrogen peroxide on a wound
Thus, more amount of products can 
be obtained in a reversible reaction by the 
periodical removal of one of the products or 
the periodical addition of the reactants.
2H2O2(aq) 
 2H2O(l) + O2(g)
Irreversible Reactions
The reaction that cannot be reversed is 
called irreversible reaction. The irreversible 
reactions are unidirectional, i.e., they take 
place only in the forward direction. Consider 
the combustion of coal into carbon dioxide and 
water.
C(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + Heat
 
Coal 
Oxygen Carbon dioxide
In this reaction, solid coal burns with 
oxygen and gets converted into carbon dioxide 
gas and water. As the product is a gas, as soon 
as it is formed it escapes out of the reaction 
container. It is extremely hard to decompose 
a gas into a solid. Thus, the backward 
reaction is not possible in this case. So, it is an 
irreversible reaction. Table 10.2 provides the

in your higher classes.
 10.2   RATE OF A CHEMICAL 
REACTION
So far we discussed various types of 
chemical reactions and the nature of the 
reactants and products. Let us consider the 
following reactions:
 
 Rusting of iron
 
 Digestion of food
 
 Burning of petrol
 
 Weathering of rock
How fast is each reaction? Rank them from 
the slowest to fastest. How will you determine, 
which is the fastest and which is the slowest? 
One of the ways to find out how fast a reaction 
is  as follows: Measure the amount of reactants 
or products before and after a specific period 
of time. For example, let us assume that 100 g 
of a substance ‘A’ undergoes a reaction and 
after an hour 50 g of ‘A’ is left. 
A → Product
In another instance, 100 g of substance ‘C’ 
undergoes a reaction and after an hour, 20 g of 
‘C’ is left. 
C → Product
Can you say which is the faster reaction? 
In the first reaction, 50 g of the reactant (A) is 
converted into products whereas in the second 
reaction 80 g of the reactant is converted into 
products in one hour. So, the second reaction is 
faster. This measurement is called ‘the reaction 
rate’.
“Rate of a reaction is the change in the 
amount or concentration of any one of the 
reactants or products per unit time”.
Consider the following reaction
A → B
The rate of this reaction is given by
Rate = –d[A]
dt  = +d[B]
dt
Where,
[A] – Concentration of A
[B] – Concentration of B
The negative sign indicates the decrease in 
the concentration of A with time.
The postive sign indicates the increase in 
the concentration of B with time.
Note: ‘[ ]’ represents the concentration, ‘d’ 
represents the infinitesimal change in the 
concentration.
Why is reaction rate important? 
Faster the reaction, more will be the 
amount of the product in a specified time. So, 
the rate of a reaction is important for a chemist 
for designing a process to get a good yield of a 
product. Rate of reaction is also important for 
a food processor who hopes to slow down the 
reactions that cause food to spoil. 
10.2.1  Factors influencing the 
rate of a reaction
Can the rate of a reaction be changed? 
The rate of a reaction can be changed. For

10th Standard Science
example, iron gets rusted faster in an acid than 
in water. Important factors that affect rate of a 
reaction are
(i) 
Nature of the reactants
(ii) Concentration of the reactants
(iii) Temperature
(iv) Catalyst
(v) Pressure
(vi) Surface area of the reactants
(i) Nature of the reactants
The reaction of sodium with hydrochloric 
acid is faster than that  with acetic acid. Do you 
know why? Hydrochloric acid is a stronger acid 
than acetic acid and thus more reactive. So, the 
nature of the reactants influence the reaction 
rate.
2Na(s) + 2HCl(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + H2 (g) (fast)
2Na(s) + 2CH3COOH(aq) → 2CH3COONa(aq) + H2(g)(slow)
(ii) Concentration of the reactants
Changing the amount of the reactants also 
increases the reaction rate. The amount of the 
substance present in a certain volume of the 
solution is called ‘concentration’. More the 
concentration, more particles per volume exist 
in it and hence faster the reaction. Granulated 
zinc reacts faster with 2M hydrochloric acid 
than 1M hydrochloric acid.
(iii) Temperature
Most of the reactions go faster at higher 
temperature. Because adding heat to the 
reactants provides energy to break more bonds 
and thus speed up the reaction. Calcium 
carbonate reacts slowly with hydrochloric 
acid at room temperature. When the reaction 
mixture is heated the reaction rate increases.
Food kept at room temperature 
spoils faster than that kept 
in  the refrigerator. In the 
refrigerator, the temperature is lower 
than the room temperature and hence the 
reaction rate is less. 
(iv) Pressure
If the reactants are gases, increasing their 
pressure increases the reaction rate. This is 
because, on increasing the pressure the reacting 
particles come closer and collide frequently.
(v) Catalyst
A catalyst is a substance which increases 
the reaction rate without being consumed in 
the reaction. In certain reactions, adding a 
substance as catalyst speeds up the reaction. 
For example, on heating potassium chlorate, 
it decomposes into potassium chloride and 
oxygen gas, but at a slower rate. If manganese 
dioxide is added, it increases the reaction 
rate. 
(vi) Surface area of the reactants
When solid reactants  are involve in a 
reaction, their powdered form reacts more 
readily. For example, powdered calcium 
carbonate reacts more readily with hydrochloric 
acid than marble chips. Because, powdering of 
the reactants increases the surface area and 
more energy is available on collision of the 
reactant particles. Thus, the reaction rate is 
increased.
You will study more about reaction rate in 
you higher classes.
10.3  STATE OF EQUILIBRIUM
In a reversible reaction, both forward and 
backward reactions take place simultaneously. 
When the rate of the forward reaction becomes 
equal to the rate of backward reaction, then 
no more product is formed. This stage of the 
reaction is called ‘equilibrium state’. After this 
stage, no net change in the reaction can occur 
and hence in the amount of the reactants and 
products. Since this equilibrium is attained 
in a chemical reaction, it is called ‘Chemical 
Equilibrium’. Chemical Equilibrium: It is state 
of a reversible chemical reaction in which no 
change in the amount of the reactants and 
products takes place. At equilibrium,
Rate of forward reaction =  Rate of backward 
reaction

Types of Chemical Reactions
Explanation: Initially the rate of the 
forward reaction is greater than the rate of 
the backward reaction. However, during the 
course of reaction, the concentration of the 
reactants decreases and the concentration 
of the products increases. Since the rate of 
a reaction is directly proportional to the 
concentration, the rate of the forward reaction 
decreases with time, whereas the rate of the 
backward reaction increases.
At a certain stage, both the rates become 
equal. From this point onwards, there will be 
no change in the concentrations of both the 
reactants and the products with time. This 
state is called as equilibrium state.
Let us consider the decomposition of 
calcium carbonate into lime and carbon 
dioxide. It is a reversible reaction. The 
speed of each reaction can be determined 
by how quickly the reactant disappears. If 
the reaction is carried out in a closed vessel, 
it reaches a chemical equilibrium. At this 
stage, 
CaCO3(s) 
 CaO(s) + CO2(g)
The rate of decomposition of CaCO3 = The rate 
of combination of CaO and CO2
Not only chemical changes, physical 
changes also may attain equilibrium. When 
water kept in a closed vessel evaporates, it 
forms water vapour. No water vapour escapes 
out of the container as the process takes place 
in a closed vessel. So, it builds up the vapour 
pressure in the container. At one time, the 
water vapour condenses back into liquid 
water and when the rate of this condensation 
becomes equal to that of vapourisation, the 
process attains equilibrium. 
At this stage, the volume of the liquid 
and gaseous phases remain constant. Since it 
is a physical change, the equilibrium attained 
is called ‘Physical Equilibrium’. Physical 
equilibrium is a state of a physical change at 
which the volume of all the phases remain 
unchanged.

Characteristics of equilibrium 
 
 In a chemical equilibrium, the rates of 
the forward and backward reactions are 
equal.
 
 The observable properties such as 
pressure, concentration, colour, density, 
viscosity etc., of the system remain 
unchanged with time.
 
 The chemical equilibrium is a dynamic 
equilibrium, because both the forward 
and backward reactions continue to occur 
even though it appears static externally.
 
 In physical equilibrium, the volume of all 
the phases remain constant.
Aerated soft drinks contain dissolved 
carbon dioxide in a pop bottle (Soda). 
When the bottle is sealed, 
the dissolved carbon dioxide 
(in the form of carbonic 
acid) and gaseous CO2 are 
in equilibrium with each other. When 
you open the bottle, the gaseous CO2 can 
escape. So, the dissolved CO2 begins to 
undissolve back to the gas phase trying 
to replace the gas that was lost, when you 
opened the bottle. That’s why if you leave 
it open long enough, it  will goes ‘flat’. All 
the CO2 will be gone, blown away in the 
air.

10.4  IONIC PRODUCT OF WATER
Although pure water is often considered 
as a non-conductor of electricity, precise 
measurements show that it conducts electricity 
to a little extent. This conductivity of water has 
resulted from the self-ionisation of water. Self-
ionisation or auto ionisation is a reaction in 
which two like molecules react to give ions. 
In the process of ionisation of water, a proton 
from one water molecule is transferred to 
another water molecule leaving behind an 
OH— ion. The proton gets dissolved in water 
forming the hydronium ion as shown in the 
following equation:
H2O(l) + H2O(l) 
 H3O+
(aq) + OH–
(aq)
The hydronium ion formed is a strong 
acid and the hydroxyl ion is a strong base. So 
as fast as they are formed, they react again to 
produce water. Thus, it is a reversible reaction 
and attains equilibrium very quickly. So, 
the extent of ionisation is very little and the 
concentration of the ions produced is also very 
less. The product of the concentration of the 
hydronium ion and the hydroxyl ion is called 
‘ionic product of water’. It is denoted as ‘Kw’. 
It is mathematically expressed as follows:
Kw = [H3O+] [OH−]
[H3O+] may be simply written as [H+]. 
Thus the ionic product of water may also be 
expressed as 
Kw = [H+] [OH−]
Its unit is mol2 dm−6. At 25° C, its value is 
1.00 × 10−14. 
10.5  pH SCALE
All the aqueous solutions may contain 
hydrogen and hydroxyl ions due to self-
ionisation of water. In addition to this 
ionisation, substances dissolved in water 
also may produce hydrogen ions or hydroxyl 
ions. The concentration of these ions decides 
whether the solution is acidic or basic. pH 
scale is a scale for measuring the hydrogen 
ion concentration in a solution. The 'p' in 
pH stands for ‘Potenz’ in German meaning 
'power'. pH notation was devised by the 
Danish biochemist Sorensen in 1909. pH scale 
is a set of numbers from 0 to 14 which is used 
to indicate whether a solution is acidic, basic 
or neutral. 
 Acids have pH less than 7
 Bases have pH greater than 7
 A neutral solution has pH equal to 7
The pH is the negative logarithm of the 
hydrogen ion concentration
i.e pH = –log10[H+]

Types of Chemical Reactions
pH in our digestive system
It is very interesting to note that our 
stomach produces hydrochloric acid.  It helps 
in the digestion of food without harming the 
stomach.  During indigestion the stomach 
produces too much acid and this causes pain 
and irritation. pH of the stomach fluid is 
approximately 2.0.
pH changes as the cause of tooth decay
pH of the saliva normally ranges between 
6.5 to 7.5. White enamel coating of our teeth 
is calcium phosphate, the hardest substance in 
our body.  When the pH of the mouth saliva 
falls below 5.5, the enamel gets weathered. 
Toothpastes, which are generally basic are 
used for cleaning the teeth that can neutralise 
the excess acid and prevent tooth decay.
pH of soil
In agriculture, the pH of the soil is very 
important. Citrus fruits require slightly 
alkaline soil, while rice requires acidic soil and 
sugarcane requires neutral soil.
pH of rain water
The pH of rain water is approximately 
7, which means that it is neutral and also 
represents its high purity. If the atmospheric 
air is polluted with oxide gases of sulphur and 
nitrogen, they get dissolved in the rain water 
and make its pH less than 7. Thus, if the pH of 
rain water is less than 7, then it is called acid 
rain. When acid rain flows into the rivers it 
lowers the pH of the river water also. 
Conceptual
Thoughts
Why  pure 
water has pH 7 
at room 
temperature?
The survival of aquatic life in such rivers 
becomes difficult.
The pH of a solution can be determined 
by using a universal indicator. It contains 
a mixture of dyes. It comes in the form of a 
solution or a pH paper.
Figure 10.7 pH Indicator
A more common method of measuring 
pH in a school laboratory is by using the 
pH paper. A pH paper contains a mixture 
of indicators. It shows a specific colour at a 
given pH. A colour guide is provided with the 
bottle of the indicator or the strips of paper 
impregnated with it, which are called pH 
paper strips. The test solution is tested with a 
drop of the universal indicator, or a drop of the 
test solution is put on the pH paper. The colour 
of the solution on the pH paper is compared 
with the colour chart and the pH value is read 
from it. The pH values thus obtained are only 
approximate values.
 10.6   ROLE OF pH IN 
EVERYDAY LIFE 
Are plants and animals pH sensitive?
Our body works within the pH range 
of 7.0 to 7.8.  Living organisms can survive 
only in a narrow range of pH change. 
Different body fluids have different pH 
values. For example, pH of blood is ranging 
from 7.35 to 7.45. Any increase or decrease 
in this value leads to diseases. The ideal pH 
for blood is 7.4.

 10.7  pH CALCULATION
The pH is the negative logarithm of the 
hydrogen ion concentration
pH = –log10 [H+]
Example: Calculate the pH of 0.01 M HNO3?
Solution:
[H+] = 0.01
pH = –log10 [H+]
pH = –log10 [0.01]
pH = –log10 [1 × 10−2] 
pH = –(log101 – 2 log1010)
pH = 0 + 2 × log1010
pH = 0 + 2 × 1 = 2
pH = 2
pOH: The pOH of an aqueous solution is 
realted to the pH.
The pOH is the negative logarithm of the 
hydroxyl ion concentration
pOH = –log10[OH–]
Example: The hydroxyl ion concentration of a 
solution is 1 × 10−9M. What is the pOH of the 
solution?
Solution
pOH = –log10 [OH–]
pOH = –log10 [1 × 10−9]
pOH = –(log10 1.0 + log10 10−9)
pOH = –(0–9 log1010)
pOH = –(0 – 9)
pOH = 9
Relationship between pH and pOH
The pH and pOH of a water solution at 25oC 
are related by the following equation.
pH + pOH = 14
If either the pH or the pOH of a solution is 
known, the other value can be calculated.
Example: A solution has a pOH of 11.76. 
What is the pH of this solution?
pH = 14 – pOH
 pH = 14 – 11.76 = 2.24
 10.8  PROBLEMS
Example 1:  Calculate the pH of 0.001 molar 
solution of HCl.
Solution: HCl is a strong acid and is completely 
dissociated in its solutions according to the 
process:
HCl(aq)  →  H+
(aq) + Cl–
(aq)
 
From this process it is clear that one 
mole of HCl would give one mole of H+ ions. 
Therefore, the concentration of H+ ions would 
be equal to that of HCl, i.e., 0.001 molar or 
1.0 × 10–3 mol litre–1.
Thus, [H+] = 1 × 10–3 mol litre–1
pH = –log10[H+] = –log1010–3
 
= –(–3 × log10) = –(3 × 1) = 3
Thus, pH = 3
Example 2:  What would be the pH of an 
aqueous solution of sulphuric 
acid which is 5 × 10–5 mol litre–1 in 
concentration.
Solution: Sulphuric acid dissociates in water as:
H2SO4(aq)   →  2 H+
(aq) + SO4
2–
(aq)
Each mole of sulphuric acid gives two mole 
of H+ ions in the solution. One litre of H2SO4 
solution contains 5 × 10–5 moles of H2SO4 
which would give 2 × 5 × 10–5 = 10 × 10–5 or 
1.0 × 10–4 moles of H+ ion in one litre of the 
solution.
Therefore,
[H+] = 1.0 × 10–4 mol litre–1
pH = –log10[H+] = –log1010–4 = –(–4 × log1010)
 
= –(–4 × 1) = 4
Example 3:  Calculate the pH of 1 × 10–4 molar 
solution of NaOH.
Solution: NaOH is a strong base and dissociates 
in its solution as:
NaOH(aq)  →  Na+
(aq) + OH–
(aq)
One mole of NaOH would give one mole of 
OH– ions. Therefore,

151
Types of Chemical Reactions
[OH–] = 1 × 10–4 mol litre–1
pOH = –log10[OH–] = –log10 × [10–4]
 
 = –(–4 × log1010)= –(–4) = 4
Since, pH + pOH = 14
pH = 14 – pOH = 14 – 4
 
= 10
Example 4:  Calculate the pH of a solution in 
which the concentration of the 
hydrogen ions is 1.0 × 10–8 mol litre–1.
Solution: Here, although the solution is 
extremely dilute, the concentration given is not 
of an acid or a base but that of H+ ions. Hence, 
the pH can be calculated from the relation:
pH = –log10[H+]
given [H+] = 1.0 × 10–8 mol litre–1
pH = –log1010–8 = –(–8 × log1010)
 
= –(–8 × 1) = 8
Example 5: If the pH of a solution is 4.5, what 
is its pOH?
Solution: 
pH + pOH = 14
pOH = 14 – 4.5 = 9.5 
pOH = 9.5
