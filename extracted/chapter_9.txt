       INTRODUCTION
You have learnt about mixtures in your 
lower classes. Most of the substances that we 
encounter in our daily life are mixtures of two 
or more substances. The substances present in 
a mixture may exist in one or more physical 
state. For example, when we burn wood, the 
smoke released is a mixture of solid carbon 
and gases like CO2, CO, etc. 
In 
some 
cases 
of 
mixtures, 
their 
components can be separated easily whereas 
in some other cases they cannot be. Consider 
the two mixtures, one which contains salt and 
water, and the another which contains sand and 
water. Water is the one of the components in 
both the mixtures. In the first case salt disolves 
in water. In the second case the sand does not 
disolve in water. Sand in water can be separated 
by filtration but salt cannot be separated as 
it dissolves in water to form a homogeneous 
mixture. This kind of homogenous mixtures 
are termed as “solutions”.

is sea water. We cannot imagine life on earth 
without sea water. It is a mixture of many 
dissolved salts. The another one is air. It is a 
mixture of gases like nitrogen, oxygen, carbon 
dioxide and other gases.

Solutions
All the life forms on the earth are associated 
with solutions. Plants take solutions of nutrients 
for their growth from the soil. Most of the liquids 
found in human body including blood, lymph 
and urine are solutions. Day to day human 
activities like washing, cooking, cleaning and 
few other activities involve the formation of 
solutions with water. Similarly, the drinks what 
we take, like fruit juice, aerated drinks, tea, 
coffee etc. are also solutions. Therefore, the 
ability of water to form solutions is responsible 
for sustenance of life. 
 9.2   COMPONENTS OF 
SOLUTIONS 
We know that, a solution is a homogeneous 
mixture of two or more substances. In a 
solution, the component which is present in 
lesser amount (by weight), is called solute and the 
component, which is present in a larger amount 
(by weight) is called solvent. The solute gets 
distributed uniformly throughout the solvent 
and thus forming the mixture homogeneous. 
So, the solvent acts as a dissolving medium in 
a solution. The process of uniform distribution 
of solute into solvent is called dissolution. 
Figure 9.2 shows the schematic representation 
of solution.

Thoughts
All solutions
are mixtures; but
all mixtures are
not solutions.
why?
A solution must at least be consisting 
of two components (a solute and a solvent). 
Such solutions which are made of one solute 
and one solvent (two components) are called 
binary solutions. e.g. On adding copper 
sulphate crystals to water, it dissolves in 
water forming a solution of copper sulphate 
as shown in Figure 9.3. It contains two 
components i.e. one solute- copper sulphate 
and one solvent-water. So it is a binary 
solution. Similarly, a solution may contain 
more than two components. For  example 
if salt and sugar are added to water, both 
dissolve in water forming a solution. Here 
two solutes are dissolved in one solvent. 
Such kind of solutions which contain three 
components are called ternary solutions.

 9.3  Types of Solutions
9.3.1  Based on the physical 
state of the solute and the 
solvent
We know that substances normally exist 
in three physical states (phases) i.e., solid, 
liquid and gas. In binary solutions, both the 
solvent and solute may exist in any of these 
physical states. But the solvent constitutes 
the major part of the solution. Its physical 
state is the primary factor which determine 
the characteristics of the solution. Therefore, 
there are different types of binary solutions as 
listed in Table 9.1.

9.3.2  Based on the type of 
solvent
Most of the substances are soluble in water. 
That is why, water is called as ‘Universal solvent”. 
However some substances do not dissolve in 
water. Therefore, other solvents such as ethers, 
benzene, alcohols etc., are used to prepare 
a solution. On the basis of type of solvent, 
solutions are classified into two types. They are 
aqueous solutions and non-aqueous solutions.
a) Aqueous solution:
The solution in which water acts as a solvent 
is called aqueous solution. E.g. Common salt in 
water, Sugar in water, Copper sulphate in water 
etc.
b) Non – Aqueous solution:
The solution in which any liquid, other 
than water, acts as a solvent is called  non-
aqueous solution. Solvent other than water is 
referred to as non-aqueous solvent. Generally, 
alcohols, benzene, ethers, carbon disulphide, 
acetone, etc., are used as non-aqueous solvents. 
Examples for non-aqueous solutions:  Sulphur 
dissolved in carbon disulphide, Iodine dissolved 
in carbon tetrachloride.

9.3.3  Based on the amount of 
solute
The amount of the solute that can be 
dissolved in the given amount of solvent is 
limited under any given conditions. Based 
on the amount of solute, in the given amount 
of solvent, solutions are classified into the 
following types:
(i) 
Saturated solution
(ii) Unsaturated solution
(iii) Super saturated solution
(i) Saturated solution: A solution in 
which no more solute can be dissolved in 
a definite amount of the solvent at a given 
temperature is called saturated solution. 
e.g. 36  g of sodium chloride in 100 g of 
water at 25°C forms saturated solution.

They are schematically represented by Figure

Figure 9.5 Dilute and Concentrated Solution
Differentiating solutions as dilute and 
concentrated is a qualitative representation. 
It does not imply the quantity of the solute. 
This difference is observed by means of 
some physical characteristics such as colour, 
density, etc.

Look at the following pictures. Label 
them as dilute and concentrated solution

 9.4  Solubility
Usually, there is a limit to the amount of 
solute that can be dissolved in a given amount 
of solvent at a given temperature.  When this 
limit is reached, we have a saturated solution 
and any excess solute that is added, simply 
settle down at the bottom of the solution. The 
extent of dissolution of a solute in a solvent can 
be better explained by its solubility. Solubility 
is a measure of how much of a solute can be 
dissolved in a specified amount of a solvent.
Further addition of sodium chloride, leave it 
undissolved.
(ii) Unsaturated solution: Unsaturated 
solution is one that contains less solute than 
that of the saturated solution at a given 
temperature. e.g. 10 g or 20 g or 30 g of Sodium 
chloride in 100 g of water at 25°C forms an 
unsaturated solution.
(iii) 
Super 
saturated 
solution: 
Supersaturated solution is one that contains 
more solute than the saturated solution at 
a given temperature. e.g. 40 g of sodium 
chloride in 100 g of water at 25°C forms 
super saturated solution. This state can be 
achieved by altering any other conditions 
liken temperature,  pressure. Super saturated 
solutions are unstable, and the solute is 
reappearing as crystals when the solution is 
disturbed.
Conceptual
Thoughts
You are given
two samples of 
solutions of NaCl.
Can you identify
which one is
saturated? and 
How?
9.3.4  Concentrated and dilute 
solutions
It is another kind of classification of 
unsaturated solutions. It expresses the relative 
concentration of two solutions with respect to 
their solutes present in the given amount of the 
solvent. For example, you are given two cups of 
tea. When you taste them, you feel that one is 
sweeter than the other. What do you infer from 
it? The tea which sweet more contains higher 
amount of sugar than the other. How can you 
express your observation? You can say that the 
tea is stronger. But a chemist would say that it is 
‘concentrated’. 
When we compare two solutions having 
same solute and solvent, the one which contains 
higher amount of solute per the given amount 
of solvent is said to be ‘concentrated solution’

Solubility is defined as the number of 
grams of a solute that can be dissolved in 
100 g of a solvent to form its saturated solution at 
a given temperature and pressure.  For example, 
36 g of sodium chloride need to be dissolved 
in 100 g of water to form its saturated solution 
at 25°C. Thus the solubility of NaCl in water is 
36 g at 25°C. The solubility is mathematically 
expressed as
Solubility =
Mass of the solute × 100
Mass of the solvent

9.4.1 Factors affecting solubility 
There are three main factors which govern 
the solubility of a solute. They are:
(i) 
Nature of the solute and 
solvent
(ii) Temperature
(iii) Pressure 
(i) Nature of the solute and solvent
The nature of the solute and solvent plays 
an important role in solubility. Although water 
dissolves an enormous variety of substances, 
both ionic and covalent, it does not dissolve 
everything. The phrase that scientists often use 
when predicting solubility is “like dissolves 
like.” This expression means that dissolving 
occurs when similarities exist between the 
solvent and the solute. For example: Common 
salt is a polar compound and dissolves readily 
in polar solvent like water.  
Non-polar compounds are soluble in 
non-polar solvents. For example, Fat dissolved 
in ether. But non-polar compounds, do not 
dissolve in polar solvents; polar compounds do 
not dissolve in non-polar solvents.  
(ii) Effect of Temperature
Solubility of Solids in Liquid: 
Generally, solubility of a solid solute in 
a liquid solvent increases with increase in 
temperature. For example, a greater amount of 
sugar will dissolve in warm water than in cold 
water.
In 
endothermic 
process, 
solubility 
increases with increase in temperature.
In exothermic process, solubility decreases 
with increase in temperature.
Solubility of Gases in liquid
Do you know why is it bubbling when 
water is boiled? Solubility of gases in liquid 
decrease 
with 
increase 
in 
temperature. 
Generally, water contains dissolved oxygen. 
When water is heated, the solubility of oxygen 
in water decreases, so oxygen escapes in the 
form of bubbles.
Aquatic animals live more in cold regions 
because, more amount of dissolved oxygen is 
present in the water of cold regions. This shows 
that the solubility of oxygen in water is more at 
low temperatures.
(iii) Effect of Pressure
Effect of pressure is observed only in the 
case of solubility of a gas in a liquid. When 
the pressure is increased, the solubility of a 
gas in liquid increases. 
The common examples for solubility of 
gases in liquids are carbonated beverages, i.e. 
soft drinks, household cleaners containing

Solutions
aqueous solution of ammonia, formalin- 
aqueous solution of formaldehyde, etc.
Figure 9.6 Effect of pressure on solubility
More to know
The effect of pressure on the solubility 
of a gas in liquid is given by Henry’s law.  It 
states that, the solubility of a gas in a liquid 
is directly proportional to the pressure 
of the gas over the solution at a definite 
temperature.
 9.5  Concentration of a Solution 
So far, we discussed what is a solution? 
what does it consist of and its types. Most of 
the chemical reactions take place in solutions 
form. So it is essential to quantify the solute 
in solvent to study the reactions. To quantify 
the solute in a solution, we can use the term 
“concentration”.
Concentration of a solution may be 
defined as the amount of solute present in a 
given amount of solution or solvent.
Quantitatively, concentration of a solution 
may be expressed in different methods. But here, 
we shall discuss percentage by mass (% mass) 
and percentage by volume (% volume).   
9.5.1 Mass percentage 
Mass percentage of a solution is defined 
as the percentage by mass of the solute present 
in the solution. It is mostly used when solute is 
solid and solvent is liquid.
Mass 
Percentage = 
Mass of the solute
 × 100
Mass of the solution
Mass 
Percentage 
=
 
Mass of the solute
 × 100
Mass of the solute + 
Mass of the solvent
For example: 5% sugar solution (by mass) 
means 5 g of sugar in 95 g of water. Hence it is 
made 100g of solution.
Usually, mass percentage is expressed 
as w/w (weight / weight); mass percentage is 
independent of temperature.
9.5.2 Volume percentage
Volume percentage is defined as the 
percentage by volume of solute (in ml) present 
in the given volume of the solution.
Volume 
Percentage = 
Volume of the solute  × 100
Volume of the solution
Volume 
Percentage 
=
 
Volume of the solute
 × 100
Volume of the solute + 
volume of the solvent
For example, 10% by volume of the solution 
of ethanol in water, means 10 ml of ethanol in 
100 ml of solution (or 90 ml of water)
Usually volume percentage is expressed as 
v/v (volume / volume). It is used when both 
the solute and solvent are liquids. Volume 
percentage 
decreases 
with 
increases 
in 
temperature, because of expansion of liquid.
You can notice that in the commercial 
products that we come across in our daily 
life such as a solution of syrups, mouth wash, 
antiseptic solution, household disinfectants etc., 
the concentration of the ingredients is expressed 
as v/v. Similarly, in ointments, antacid, soaps, 
etc., the concentration of solutions are expressed 
as w/w.

 9.6   Hydrated salts and Water 
of Crystallization 
 
When ionic substances are dissolved 
in water to make their saturated aqueous 
solution, their ions attract water molecules 
which then attached chemically in certain 
ratio. This process is called hydration. These 
ionic substances crystallize out from their 
saturated aqueous solution with a definite 
number of molecules of water. The number 
of water molecules found in the crystalline 
substance is called water of crystallization. 
Such salts are called hydrated salts. 
Figure 9.8 a) Crystalline hydrated salt
b) Amorphous anhydrous salt
On heating these hydrated crystalline 
salts, they lose their water of crystallization 
and become amorphous or lose their colour 
(if they are coloured). Table 9.3 shows some 
common hydrated salts:

 9.7  Hygroscopy
Certain substances, when exposed to 
the atmospheric air at ordinary temperature, 
absorb moisture without changing their physical 
state. Such substances are called hygroscopic 
substances and this property is called hygroscopy. 
Hygroscopic substances are used as drying 
agents.
Example:  1. Conc.Sulphuric acid (H2SO4).
2. Phosphorus Pentoxide (P2O5).
3. Quick lime (CaO).
4. Silica gel (SiO2).
 9.8  Deliquescence
Certain 
substances 
which 
are 
so 
hygroscopic, when exposed to the atmospheric 
air at ordinary temperatures, absorb enough 
water and get completely dissolved. Such 
substances are called deliquescent substances 
and this property is called deliquescence.
Deliquescent 
substances 
lose 
their 
crystalline shape and ultimately dissolve in the 
absorbed water forming a saturated solution.
Deliquescence is maximum when:
1) The temperature is low 
2) The atmosphere is humid 
Examples: Caustic soda (NaOH), 
Caustic potash (KOH) and Ferric 
chloride (FeCl3).

Hygroscopic substances do not change its 
physical state on exposure to air.
Deliquescent substances change its physical 
state on exposure to air.
Hygroscopic substances may be amorphous 
solids or liquids.
Deliquescent substances are crystalline solids.
