       INTRODUCTION
Humans are very much interested in 
knowing about atoms. Things around us 
are made up of atoms. A Greek Philosopher 
'Democritus' in 400 BC(BCE) believed that 
matter is made up of tiny indestructible 
units called atoms. Later, in 1803, John 
Dalton considered that elements consist 
of atoms, which are identical in nature. 
J J Thomson discovered cathode rays, 
known as electrons, experimentally and 
Goldstein discovered positive rays, which 
were  named as protons by Rutherford. 
In 1932, James Chadwick discovered 
the chargeless particles called neutrons. 
Presently, a large number of elementary 
particles like photon, meson, positron and 
nutrino have been discovered. In 1911, 
the British scientist, Ernest Rutherford 
explained that the mass of an atom is 
concentrated in its central part called 
Nucleus. You have already learnt about 
the atomic structure in the earlier classes.

Nuclear physics
 6.1   RADIOACTIVITY
6.1.1  Discovery of radioactivity
In 1896, French physicist Henri Becquerel 
finished his research for the week and stored a 
certain amount of uranium compound away 
in a drawer for the week end. By chance, an 
unexposed photographic plate was also stored 
in the same drawer. After a week he returned 
and noticed that the film had been exposed to 
some radiation. He discovered that he could 
reproduce the effect whenever he placed 
uranium near a photographic film. Apparently, 
uranium radiated something that could affect 
a photographic plate. This phenomenon 
was called as Radioactivity. Uranium was 
identified to be a radioactive element.
Two years later, the Polish physicist 
Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie 
detected radioactivity in 'Pitchblende', a tiny 
black substance. They were not surprised 
at the radioactivity of pitchblende, which 
is known as an ore of uranium. Later, they 
discovered that the radiation was more 
intense from pure uranium. Also, it was found 
that the pitchblende had less concentration 
of uranium. They concluded that some 
other substance was present in pitchblende. 
After separating this new substance, they 
discovered that it had unknown chemical 
properties and it also emitted radiations 
spontaneously like uranium. They named this 
new substance as 'Radium'.The radioactive 
elements emit harmful radioactive radiations 
like alpha rays or beta rays or gamma rays.
6.1.2  Definition of radioactivity
The nucleus of some elements is unstable. 
Such nuclei undergo nuclear decay and get 
converted into more stable nuclei. During this 
nuclear reaction, these nuclei emit certain 
harmful radiations and elementary particles. The 
phenomenon of nuclear decay of certain elements 
with the emission of radiations like alpha, beta, 
and gamma rays is called 'radioactivity' and the 
elements, which undergo this phenomenon are 
called 'radioactive elements'.
6.1.3 Natural Radioactivity
The elements such as uranium and radium 
undergo radioactivity and emit the radiations 
on their own without any human intervention. 
This phenomenon of spontaneous emission of 
radiation from certain elements on their own 
is called 'natural radioactivity'. 
The elements  whose atomic number 
is more than 82 undergo spontaneous 
radioactivity. Eg: uranium, radium, etc. There 
are only two elements, which have been 
identified as radioactive substances with atomic 
number less than 82. They are technetium (Tc) 
with atomic number 43 and promethium (Pm) 
with atomic number 61.
There have been 29 radioactive 
substances discovered so far. 
Most of them are rare earth 
metals and transition metals.
6.1.4  Artificial Radioactivity (or) 
Induced Radioactivity
The phenomenon by which even light 
elements are made radioactive, by artificial 
or induced methods, is called 'artificial 
radioactivity' or 'man-made radioactivity'. 
This kind of radioactivity was discovered 
by Irene Curie and F.Joliot in 1934. Artificial 
radioactivity is induced in certain lighter 
elements like boron, aluminium etc., by 
bombarding them with radiations such as 
'alpha particles' emitted during the natural 
radioactivity of uranium. This also results 
in the emission of invisible radiations 
and elementary particles. During such a 
disintegration, the nucleus which undergoes 
disintegration is called 'parent nucleus' and that 
which is produced after the disintegration is 
called a 'daughter nucleus'. The particle, which 
10th_Science_Unit-6.indd   75

76
10th Standard Science
is used to induce the artificial disintegration is 
termed as projectile and the particle which is 
produced after the disintegration is termed as 
ejected particle. When the projectile hits the 
parent nucleus, it is converted into an unstable 
nucleus, which in turn decays spontaneously 
emitting the daughter nucleus along with an 
ejected particle.
 Activity 6.1
Using the periodic table, list out the radioac-
tive elements. Also identify the name of the 
groups in which they are present.
If you denote the parent and daughter 
nuclei as X and Y respectively, then the nuclear 
disintegration is represented as follows: X 
(P,E) Y. Here, P and E represent the projectile 
particle and ejected particle respectively.
Example:
4Be9  +  2 He 4 
 6C13*
6C13* 
 6C12 +   0n1
In the above nuclear reaction, 6C13* is unstable 
and is radioactive. This reaction can be 
represented as 4Be9 (α, n) 6C12
4Be9 + 2He4 
 6C12 + 0n1
6.1.5 Units of Radioactivity
Curie: It is the traditional 
unit of radioactivity. It is 
defined as the quantity of 
a 
radioactive 
substance 
which undergoes 3.7 × 
1010 disintegrations in one 
second. This is actually close to the activity of 
1 g of radium 226.
1 curie =  3.7 × 1010 disintegrations per second.
Rutherford (Rd): It is another unit of 
radioactivity. It is defined as the quantity 
of a radioactive substance, which produces 
106 disintegrations in one second.
1 Rd = 106 disintegrations per second.
Becquerel (Bq) : It is The SI unit of 
radioactivity is becquerel. It is defined as the 
quantity of one disintegration per second. 
Roentgen (R): It is  The radiation exposure 
of γ and x-rays is measured by another unit 
called roentgen. One roentgen is defined 
as the quantity of radioactive substance 
which produces a charge of 2.58 × 10-4 
coulomb in 1 kg of air under standard 
conditions of pressure, temperature and 
humidity.

Nuclear physics
6.2.2  Radioactive displacement 
law
In 1913, Soddy and Fajan framed the 
displacement laws governing the daughter 
nucleus produced during an alpha and beta 
decay. They are stated below:
(i) When a radioactive element emits an 
alpha particle, a daughter nucleus is formed 
whose mass number is less by 4 units and 
the atomic number is less by 2 units, than 
the mass number and atomic number of the 
parent nucleus.
(ii) When a radioactive element emits a 
beta particle, a daughter nucleus is formed 
whose mass number is the same and the 
atomic number is more by 1 unit, than the 
atomic number of the parent nucleus.
 6.2    ALPHA, BETA AND  
GAMMA RAYS 
When a radioactive nucleus undergoes 
radioactivity, it emits harmful radiations. These 
radiations are usually comprised of any of the 
three types of particles. They are alpha(α), 
beta (β) and gamma(γ) rays. 
Uranium, named after the 
planet Uranus, was discovered 
by Martin Klaproth, a German 
chemist in a mineral called pitchblende.
6.2.1  Properties of Alpha, Beta 
and Gamma rays 
These three particles possess certain 
similarities and dissimilarities in their 
properties as listed below in Table 6.2.

6.2.3 Alpha decay
A nuclear reaction in which an unstable 
parent nucleus emits an alpha particle and forms 
a stable daughter nucleus, is called 'alpha decay'. 
E.g.: Decay of uranium (U238) to thorium 
(Th234) with the emission of an alpha particle. 
92 U 238 
 90 Th234   +2  He 4 ( α - decay )
In α - decay, the parent nucleus emits an α 
particle and so it is clear that for the daughter 
nucleus, the mass number decreases by four 
and the atomic number decreases by two as 
illustrated in Figure 6.1
Figure 6.1 Alpha decay
6.2.4 Beta decay 
A nuclear reaction, in which an unstable 
parent nucleus emits a beta particle and forms 
a stable daughter nucleus, is called 'beta decay'. 
E.g.: Beta decay of phosphorous.
15P32 
 16S32 + -1e0 (β - decay)
In β - decay there is no change in the mass 
number of the daughter nucleus but the atomic 
number increases by one.
Note: In a nuclear reaction, the element 
formed as the product nucleus is identified by 
the atomic number of the resulting nucleus 
and not by its mass number. 
6.2.5 Gamma decay
In a γ - decay, only the energy level of 
the nucleus changes. The atomic number 
and mass number of the radioactive nucleus 
remain the same.
 6.3  NUCLEAR FISSION 
6.3.1 Definition
In 
1939, 
German 
Scientist Otto Hahn and 
F.Strassman discovered that 
when a uranium nucleus is 
bombarded with a neutron, it breaks up into two 
smaller nuclei of comparable mass along with 
the emission of a few neutrons and energy. This 
process of breaking (splitting) up of a heavier 
nucleus into two smaller nuclei with the release 
of a large amount of energy and a few neutrons 
is called 'nuclear fission'.
E.g.: Nuclear fission of a uranium 
nucleus (U235) 
92U235 + 0n1 
 56Ba141 + 36Kr92 + 30n1 + Q (energy)
The average energy released in each fission 
process is about 3.2 × 10
-11 J. Nuclear fission is 
pictorially represented in Figure 6.2.
Figure 6.2 Nuclear fission
6.3.2 Fissionable materials
A fissionable material is a radioactive 
element, which undergoes fission in a 
sustained manner when it absorbs a neutron. 
It is also termed as 'fissile material'. 
E.g.: U235, plutonium (Pu239 and Pu241)
All isotopes of uranium do not undergo 
nuclear fission when they absorb a neutron. 
For example, natural uranium consists of 
99.28 % of 92U
238 and 0.72 % of 92U
235. Of 
these two, U238 does not undergo fission

Nuclear physics
material. This results in the release of a huge 
amount of energy within a fraction of a second. 
This kind of chain reaction is used in the atom 
bomb to produce an explosion. Figure 6.3 
represents an uncontrolled chain reaction.

Figure 6.3 Uncontrolled chain reaction
6.3.4 Critical Mass
During a nuclear fission process, about 2 to 
3 neutrons are released. But, all these neutrons 
may not be available to produce further fission. 
Some of them may escape from the system, 
which is termed as 'leakage of neutrons' and 
some may be absorbed by the non-fissionable 
materials present in the system. These two factors 
lead to the loss of neutrons. To sustain the chain 
reaction, the rate of production of neutrons due 
to nuclear fission must be more than the rate of 
its loss. This can be achieved only when the size 
(i.e., mass) of the fissionable material is equal to a 
certain optimum value. This is known as 'critical 
mass'. 
The minimum mass of a fissile material 
necessary to sustain the chain reaction is called 
'critical mass (mc)'. It depends on the nature, 
density and the size of the fissile material. 
If the mass of the fissile material is less than 
the critical mass, it is termed as 'subcritical'. If 
the mass of the fissile material is more than the 
critical mass, it is termed as 'supercritical'.
 Activity 6.2
Using beads make a chain reaction model
whereas U235 undergoes fission. Hence, U235 
is a fissionable material and U238 is non-
fissionable.
There are some radioactive elements, 
which can be converted into fissionable 
material. They are called as fertile materials.
E.g.: 
Uranium-238, 
Thorium-232, 
Plutonium-240.
6.3.3 Chain Reaction
A uranium nucleus (U-235) when 
bombarded with a neutron undergoes 
fission producing three neutrons. These 
three neutrons in turn can cause fission in 
three other uranium nuclei present in the 
sample, thus producing nine neutrons. These 
nine neutrons in turn may produce twenty 
seven neutrons and so on. This is known as 
'chain reaction'. A chain reaction is a self-
propagating process in which the number of 
neutrons goes on multiplying rapidly almost 
in a geometrical progression.
Two kinds of chain reactions are possible. 
They are: (i) controlled chain reaction and 
(ii)uncontrolled chain reaction. 
(a) Controlled chain reaction 
In the controlled chain reaction the 
number of neutrons released is maintained 
to be one. This is achieved by absorbing 
the extra neutrons with a neutron absorber 
leaving only one neutron to produce further 
fission. Thus, the reaction is sustained in a 
controlled manner. The energy released due 
to a controlled chain reaction can be utilized 
for constructive purposes. Controlled chain 
reaction is used in a nuclear reactor to 
produce energy in a sustained and controlled 
manner.
(b) Uncontrolled chain reaction 
In the uncontrolled chain reaction the 
number of neutrons multiplies indefinitely and 
causes fission in a large amount of the fissile

10th Standard Science
6.3.5 Atom bomb
The atom bomb is based on the principle of 
uncontrolled chain reaction. In an uncontrolled 
chain reaction, the number of neutrons and the 
number of fission reactions multiply almost in 
a geometrical progression. This releases a huge 
amount of energy in a very small time interval 
and leads to an explosion.
Structure:
An atom bomb consists of a piece of fissile 
material whose mass is subcritical. This piece 
has a cylindrical void. It has a cylindrical 
fissile material which can fit into this void and 
its mass is also subcritical. When the bomb 
has to be exploded, this cylinder is injected 
into the void using a conventional explosive. 
Now, the two pieces of fissile material join to 
form the supercritical mass, which leads to an 
explosion. The structure of an atom bomb is 
shown in  Figure 6.4

Figure 6.4 Atom bomb
During 
this 
explosion 
tremendous 
amount of energy in the form of heat, light 
and radiation is released. A region of very 
high temperature and pressure is formed in a 
fraction of a second along with the emission 
of hazardous radiation like γ rays, which 
adversely affect the living creatures. This 
type of atom bombs were exploded in 1945 
at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan during 
the World War II.
 6.4  NUCLEAR FUSION
You have learnt that 
energy can be produced 
when a heavy nucleus is 
split up into two smaller 
nuclei. Similarly, energy 
can be produced when two 
lighter nuclei combine to form a heavier 
nucleus. This phenomenon is known as 
nuclear fusion.
6.4.1 Definition
The process in which two lighter nuclei 
combine to form a heavier nucleus is termed 
as 'nuclear fusion'.
E.g.:  1H2 + 1H2 
 2He4 + Q (Energy)
Here, 
1H2 represents an isotope of 
hydrogen known as 'deuterium'. The average 
energy released in each fusion reaction is 
about 3.84 × 10-12 J. Figure 6.5 represents this.
Figure 6.5 Nuclear fusion
Electron Volt (eV) is the unit used 
in nuclear physics to measure 
the energy of small particles. It 
is nothing but the energy of one 
electron when it is accelerated using an electric 
potential of one volt.
1eV = 1.602 × 10-19 joule. 
1 million electron volt = 1 MeV = 106 eV 
 
(mega electron volt)
The energy released in a nuclear fission 
process is about 200 MeV.

81
Nuclear physics
The mass of the daughter nucleus formed 
during a nuclear reaction (fission and fusion) 
is lesser than the sum of the masses of the 
two parent nuclei. This difference in mass is 
called mass defect. This mass is converted 
into energy, according to the mass-energy 
equivalence. This concept of mass-energy 
equivalence was proposed by Einstein in 
1905. It stated that mass can be converted into 
energy and vice versa. The relation between 
mass and energy proposed by Einstein is 
E = mc2 where c is the velocity of light in 
vacuum and is equal to 3 × 108 ms–1.
The nuclear bomb that was 
dropped in Hiroshima during 
World War II was called as 
'Little boy'. It was a gun-type bomb which 
used a uranium core. The bomb, which was 
subsequently dropped over Nagasaki was 
called as 'Fat man'. It was an explosion type 
bomb, which used a plutonium core.
6.4.2  Conditions necessary for 
nuclear fusion
Earth’s atmosphere contains a small trace 
of hydrogen. If nuclear fusion is a spontaneous 
process at normal temperature and pressure, 
then a number of fusion processes would 
happen in the atmosphere which may lead to 
explosions. But, we do not encounter any such 
explosions. Can you explain why?
The answer is that nuclear fusion can 
take place only under certain conditions. 
Nuclear fusion is possible only at an 
extremly high temperature of the order of 
107 to 109 K and a high pressure to push the 
hydrogen nuclei closer to fuse with each 
other. Hence, it is named as 'Thermonuclear 
reaction'.
Nuclear 
fusion 
is 
the 
combination of two lighter 
nuclei. The charge of both 
nuclei is positive. According to electrostatic 
theory, when they come closer they tend to 
repel each other. This repulsive force will 
be overcome by the kinetic energy of the 
nuclei at higher temperature of the order of 
107 to 109 K.
6.4.3 Stellar Energy
The stars like our Sun emit a large 
amount of energy in the form of light and 
heat. This energy is termed as the stellar 
energy. Where does this high energy come 
from? All stars contain a large amount of 
hydrogen. The surface temperature of the 
stars is very high which is sufficient to 
induce fusion of the hydrogen nuclei. 
Fusion reaction that takes place in the 
cores of the Sun and other stars results in an 
enormous amount of energy, which is called 
as 'stellar energy. Thus, nuclear fusion or 
thermonuclear reaction is the source of 
light and heat energy in the Sun and other 
stars.
6.4.4 Hydrogen Bomb
Hydrogen bomb is based on the 
principle of nuclear fusion. A hydrogen 
bomb is always designed to have an 
inbuilt atom bomb which creates the high 
temperature and pressure required for 
fusion when it explodes. Then, fusion takes 
place in the hydrogen core and leads to the 
release of a very large amount of energy 
in an uncontrolled manner. The energy 
released in a hydrogen bomb (or fusion 
bomb) is much higher than that released in 
an atom bomb (or fission bomb).

10th Standard Science
Sun fuses about 620 million 
metric tons of hydrogen each 
second and radiates about 
3.8 × 1026 joule of energy per second. 
When this energy is radiated towards the 
Earth, it decreases in its intensity. When it 
reaches the Earth its value is about 1.4 kilo 
joule per unit area in unit time.
 6.5  USES OF RADIOACTIVITY
Many radio isotopes 
can 
be 
obtained 
from 
radioactivity. These radio 
isotopes have found wide 
variety of applications in 
the fields of medicine, 
agriculture, industry and archeological 
research.
6.5.1 Agriculture
The radio isotope of phosphorous (P-32) 
helps to increase the productivity of crops. 
The radiations from the radio isotopes can 
be used to kill the insects and parasites and 
prevent the wastage of agricultural products. 
Certain perishable cereals exposed to 
radiations remain fresh beyond their normal 
life, enhancing the storage time. Very small 
doses of radiation prevent sprouting and 
spoilage of onions, potatoes and gram.
6.5.2 Medicine
Medical applications of radio isotopes 
can be divided into two parts:
i) Diagnosis ii) Therapy
Radio isotopes are used as tracers to 
diagnose the nature of circulatory disorders 
of blood, defects of bone metabolism, to 
locate tumors, etc. Some of the radio isotopes 
which are used as tracers are: hydrogen, 
carbon, nitrogen, sulphur, etc.
•  Radio sodium (Na24) is used for the 
effective functioning of heart. 
•  Radio – Iodine (I131) is used to cure goiter. 
•  Radio-iron is (Fe59) is used to diagnose 
anaemia and also to provide treatment for 
the same.
•  Radio phosphorous (P32) is used in the 
treatment of skin diseases.

•  Radio cobalt (Co60) and radio-gold 
(Au198) are used in the treatment of skin 
cancer.
•  Radiations are used to sterilize the surgical 
devices as they can kill the germs and 
microbes. 
6.5.3 Industries
In industries, radioactive isotopes are 
used as tracers to detect any manufacturing 
defects such as cracks and leaks.  Packaging 
faults can also be identified through radio 
activity. Gauges, which have radioactive 
sources are used in many industries to check 
the level of gases, liquids and solids. 
• 
An isotope of californium (Cf 252) 
is used in the airlines to detect the 
explosives in the luggage. 
• 
An isotope of Americium (Am241) is 
used in many industries as a smoke 
detector. 
6.5.4. Archeological research
Using the technique of radio carbon 
dating, the age of the Earth, fossils, 
old paintings and monuments can be 
determined. 
In 
radio 
carbon 
dating, 
the existing amount of radio carbon is 
determined and this gives an estimate about 
the age of these things.
 6.6  SAFETY MEASURES
In day to day life, you do receive 
some natural radiation from the Sun. The 
radioactive elements present in the soil 
and rocks, the house hold appliances like 
television, microwave ovens, cell phones and 
the X-rays used in hospitals. These radiations 
do not produce any severe effects as they are 
very low in intensity. 
 The second source of radiation 
exposure is man-made. These are due to 
nuclear reactors and during the testing of 
the nuclear devices in the atmosphere or in 
the ground.
Improper and careless handling of 
radioactive 
materials 
release 
harmful 
radiations 
in 
our 
environment. 
These 
radiations are very harmful to the human 
body. A person who is exposed to radiations 
very closely or for a longer duration, is at 
a greater health risk and can be affected 
genetically.
How old is our mother Earth? 
Any guess?? It is nearly 4.54 × 
109 years (around 45 Crore 40 
lakh years). Wow!!
6.6.1 Permitted range
The 
International 
Commission 
on 
Radiological 
Protection 
(ICRP) 
has 
recommended certain maximum permissible 
exposure limits to radiation that is believed 
to be safe without producing any appreciable 
injury to a person. Safe limit of overall exposure 
to radiation is given as 20 milli sievert per year. 
In terms of roentgen, the safe limit of receiving 
the radiation is about 100 mR per week. If the 
exposure is 100 R, it may cause fatal diseases 
like leukemia (death of red blood corpuscle in 
the blood) or cancer. When the body is exposed 
to about 600 R, it leads to death. 
*Dosimeter is a device used to 
detect the levels of exposure to an 
ionizing radiation. It is frequently 
used in the environments where exposure to 
radiation may occur such as nuclear power plants 
and medical imaging facilities. Pocket dosimeter 
is used to provide the wearer with an immediate 
reading of his/her exposure to X-rays and γ rays.

6.6.2  Preventive measures 
Figure. 6.6 Lead coated aprons model.
• 
Radioactive materials should be kept in a 
thick walled lead container.
• 
Lead coated aprons and lead gloves should 
be used while working with hazardous 
radioactive materials. 
• 
You should avoid eating while handling 
radioactive materials. 
• 
The radioactive materials should be 
handled only by tongs or by a remote 
control device.
• 
Dosimeters should be worn by the users 
to check the level of radiation. 
 6.7  NUCLEAR REACTOR 
A Nuclear reactor is a device in which 
the nuclear fission reaction takes place in 
a self-sustained and controlled manner to 
produce electricity. The first nuclear reactor 
was built in 1942 at Chicago, USA.
6.7.1 Types of nuclear reactors 
Breeder reactor, fast breeder reactor, 
pressurized water reactor, pressurized heavy 
water reactor, boiling water reactor, water-
cooled reactor, gas-cooled reactor, fusion 
reactor and thermal reactor are some types of 
nuclear reactors, which are used in different 
places world-wide.
6.7.2  Components of a nuclear 
reactors
The essential components of a nuclear 
reactor are (i) fuel, (ii) moderator, (iii) control 
rod, (iv) coolant and (v) protection wall.
i. Fuel: A fissile material is used as the 
fuel. The commonly used fuel material is 
uranium.
ii. Moderator: A moderator is used to slow 
down the high energy neutrons to provide 
slow neutrons. Graphite and heavy water 
are the commonly used moderators.
iii. Control rod: Control rods are used to 
control the number of neutrons in order 
to have sustained chain reaction. Mostly 
boron or cadmium rods are used as 
control rods. They absorb the neutrons.
iv. Coolant: A coolant is used to remove 
the heat produced in the reactor core, to 
produce steam. This steam is used to run 
a turbine in order to produce electricity. 
Water, air and helium are some of the 
coolants.
v. Protection wall: A thick concrete  lead 
wall is built around the nuclear reactor in 
order to prevent the harmful radiations 
from escaping into the environment.

6.7.3 Uses of a nuclear reactor
• 
Nuclear reactors are widely used in power 
generation.
• 
They are also used to produce radio isotopes, 
which are used in a variety of applications.
• 
Some reactors help us to do research in 
the field of nuclear physics.
• 
Breeder reactors are used to convert non-
fissionable materials into fissionable materials.

Solved problem 6.2
A radon specimen emits radiation of 
3.7 × 103 GBq per second. Convert this 
disintegration in terms of curie. (one curie  = 
3.7 × 1010 disintegration per second)  
          1 Bq =  one disintegration per second
one curie   =  3.7 × 1010 Bq
     1 Bq       =             curie 
∴ 3.7  × 103 G Bq =  3.7 × 103 × 10 9 × 
1
3.7 × 1010
                          = 100 curie
Solved problem 6.3
92U235 experiences one α - decay and 
one β - decay. Find number of neutrons in 
the final daughter nucleus that is formed. 
Solution: 
Let X and Y be the resulting nucleus after 
the emission of the alpha and beta particles 
respectively.
92U235    α decay  
90X231 + 2 He4 
90X231        β decay          91Y231  + -1 e 0
Number of neutrons = Mass number – Atomic number 
 
= 231 – 91  = 140
Solved problem 6.4 
Calculate the amount of energy released 
when a radioactive substance undergoes fusion 
and results in a mass defect of 2 kg.
Solution:
Mass defect in the reaction (m)   = 2 kg
Velocity of light (c)           = 3 × 108 m s-1
By Einstein’s equation,  
Energy released             E = mc2
So 
E = 2 × (3 × 108)2 
 
                    = 1.8 × 1017 J
