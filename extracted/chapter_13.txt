      Introduction 
The variety in nature and habits of 
animals in the biosphere are quite amazing and 
interesting. What we see around us may be just 
few, but there are innumerable species living in 
this world. You have learnt in lower classes about 
the classification of animal kingdom. We will 
recall here that â€˜Kingdom Animaliaâ€™ is divided 
into two groups, Invertebrates and Chordates. 
There occurs a great diversity in the habit, 
habitat, structural organisation and mode of 
reproduction between the animals existing 
on earth. In this chapter, you will understand 
the structural morphology and anatomy of an 
Invertebrate (Leech) and a Vertebrate (Rabbit). 
The scientific name of the Indian cattle 
leech is Hirudinaria granulosa which 
belongs to Phylum Annelida. Annelids are 
metamerically segmented worms with well 
developed organ systems. 
The scientific name of the common rabbit 
is Oryctolagus cuniculus. It is represents 
Phylum Chordata and Class Mammalia. 
Mammals occupy the highest group in the 
animal kingdom and show advancement over 
the other groups of animals. They are warm 
blooded and possess covering of hair on the 
body. Mammary gland in females is the most 
striking feature of a mammal. Let us now 
study about the morphology of leech and 
rabbit in detail.

13.1.1 Habit and Habitat
Hirudinaria granulosa (Indian Cattle 
Leech) is found in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, 
Myanmar and Srilanka. It lives in freshwater 
ponds, lakes, swamps and slow streams. They 
are ectoparasitic and feed on the blood of fishes, 
frogs, cattle and human. It is sanguivorous 
(blood sucking) in nature.
13.1.2  External Morphology
Shape and Size: The body of a leech is soft, 
vermiform, elongated and segmented. It becomes 
ribbon shaped when extended and almost 
cylindrical when contracted. Leeches may grow 
to a length of 35cm. 
Colouration: Dorsal surface is olive green 
in colour and the ventral surface is orange 
yellow or orange red in colour. 
Segmentation: 
Metamerism 
is 
the 
segmentation of the body. The body of leech is 
metamerically divided into 33 segments. The 
segments are arranged one behind the other. 
Each segment is further superficially subdivided 
into rings or annuli. A temporary clitellum is 
formed on segments 9-11, which is meant to 
produce a cocoon during the breeding season.
Receptors: On the dorsal side there are 
five pairs of eyes on the first five segments. 
Each segment bears a number of sensory 
projections 
called 
receptors. 
Annular 
receptors are located in each annulus and 
segmental receptors are located on the first 
annulus of each segment. 
Suckers: Leech has two suckers. The 
sucker located at the anterior end is called 
anterior sucker or oral sucker which is ventral 
in position occupying the first five segments. 
The posterior sucker is formed by the fusion 
of the last seven segments. The anterior sucker 
helps in feeding, while both the suckers help in 
attachment and locomotion. 
External apertures
(i) 
Mouth: It is located in the middle of 
anterior sucker.
(ii) Anus: Anus is a small aperture that 
opens on the mid-dorsal side of 26th 
segment.
(iii) Nephridiopores: Nephridia open to the 
exterior by 17 pairs of nephridiopores. 
They lie ventrally on the last annulus of 
each segment from 6 to 22.
(iv) Male genital pore: It is a mid-ventral 
opening, situated between second and 
third annuli of 10th segment.

between second and third annuli of 11th 
segment.
13.1.3 Divisions of the Body
The body of leech is divided into six 
regions.
Region
Segments
Cephalic region
1st - 5th
Pre-clitellar region
6th, 7th and 8th
Clitellar region
9th, 10th and 11th

13.1.4 Body wall
Body wall of leech includes five layers: 
(i) cuticle (outermost layer) (ii) epidermis 
which lies below the cuticle (iii) dermis 
which lies below the epidermis formed 
of connective tissue (iv) muscular layer 
formed 
of 
circular 
and 
longitudinal 
muscles (v)Â  botryoidal tissue lies beneath 
longitudinal muscles and fills the entire 
coelom around the gut.
13.1.5 Locomotion
Locomotion in leech takes place by (i) 
looping or crawling movement (ii) Swimming 
movement. 
 Activity 1
(i)  Observe the external morphology of leech 
specimen in your biology laboratory.
(ii)  Can you find leeches in your locality?
(iii)  In which geographical areas are 
leeches found more predominantly in 
India?
(i) Looping or Crawling movement
This type of movement is brought about by 
the contraction and relaxation of muscles. The two 
suckers serve for attachment during movement 
on a substratum. 
(ii) Swimming movement
Leeches swim very actively and perform 
undulating movements in water.
13.1.6 Digestive System
The digestive system includes the long 
alimentary canal and the digestive glands.
Alimentary Canal
The alimentary canal of leech is a straight 
tube running from the mouth to the anus. 
Mouth is a triradiate aperture situated in 
the middle of the anterior sucker that leads 
into the small buccal cavity. The wall of the 
buccal cavity bears three jaws with single row 
of minute teeth. The jaws are provided with 
papillae which bear the openings of salivary 
glands. Mouth and buccal cavity occupy the 
first five segments.
The buccal cavity leads into muscular 
pharynx. It is surrounded by salivary glands. 
The secretion of saliva contains hirudin which 
prevents the coagulation of blood. Pharynx 
leads into crop through a short and narrow 
oesophagus.
Crop is the largest portion of the alimentary 
canal. It is divided into a series of 10 chambers. 
The chambers communicate with one another 
through circular apertures surrounded by 
sphincters. A pair of lateral, backwardly 
directed caecae arises as blind outgrowth from 
each chamber known as caeca or diverticula. 
Crop and its diverticula can store large amount 
of blood which can be slowly digested. 
The last chamber of crop opens into 
stomach. The stomach leads into intestine which 
is a small straight tube that opens into rectum. 
The rectum opens to the exterior by anus.

10th Standard Science
Food, Feeding and Digestion
The leech feeds by sucking the blood of 
cattle and other domestic animals. During 
feeding the leech attaches itself to its victim 
strongly by the posterior sucker. The leech 
makes a triradiate or Y shaped incision in 
the skin of the host by the jaws protruded 
through the mouth. The blood is sucked by 
muscular pharynx and the salivary secretion 
is poured.
The ingested blood is stored in crop 
chambers and its diverticulum. The blood 
passes from the crop into the stomach. 
Digestion takes place in stomach by the 
action of proteolytic enzyme. The digested 
blood is then absorbed slowly by the intestine. 
Undigested food is stored in rectum and 
egested through anus.
Leeches 
prevent 
blood 
clotting 
by 
secreting a protein called hirudin. They also 
inject an anaesthetic substance that prevents 
the host from feeling their bite.

13.1.7 Respiratory System
Respiration takes place through the skin in 
leech. Dense network of tiny blood vessels called 
as capillaries containing the haemocoelic fluid 
extend in between the cells of the epidermis. 
The exchange of respiratory gases takes place 
by diffusion. Oxygen dissolved in water diffuses 
through the skin into haemocoelic fluid, while 
More to Know
 
Â‹ Leeches do not have ear, hence can 
sense vibrations through their skin.
 
Â‹ Leeches have 2 to 10 tiny eyes, which 
helps them to locate their food.
 
Â‹ Leeches can suck blood five times more 
than their body weight.
 
Â‹ It may take more than a year for the 
complete digestion and absorption of 
a full meal.

Structural Organisation of Animals
carbon dioxide diffuses out. The skin is kept 
moist and slimy due to secretion of mucus 
which also prevents it from drying.
13.1.8 Circulatory System 
In leech, circulation is brought about 
by haemocoelic system. There are no true 
blood vessels. The blood vessels are replaced 
by channels called haemocoelic channels or 
canals filled with blood like fluid. The coelomic 
fluid contains haemoglobin. 
There are four longitudinal channels. One 
channel lies above (dorsal) the alimentary canal, 
one below (ventral) the alimentary canal. The 
other two channels lie on either (lateral) side 
of the alimentary canal which serve as heart 
and have inner valves. All the four channels 
are connected together posteriorly in the 26th 
segment.
13.1.9 Nervous System 
The central nervous system of leech consists 
of a nerve ring and a paired ventral nerve 
cord. The nerve ring surrounds the pharynx 
and is formed of suprapharyngeal ganglion 
(brain), circumpharyngeal connective and 
subpharyngeal ganglion. The subpharyngeal 
ganglion lies below the pharynx and is formed 
by the fusion of four pairs of ganglia.
13.1.10 Excretory System
In leech, excretion takes place by 
segmentally arranged paired tubules called 
nephridia. There are 17 pairs of nephridia 
which open out by nephridiopores from 6th to 
22nd segments. 
13.1.11 Reproductive System
Leech is hermaphrodite because both 
the male and female reproductive organs are 
present in the same animal.
Male Reproductive System 
There are eleven pairs of testes, one pair 
in each segment from 12 to 22 segments. They 
are in the form of spherical sacs called testes 
sacs. From each testis arises a short duct called 
vas efferens, which join with the vas deferens. 
The vas deferens becomes convoluted to form 
the epididymis or sperm vesicle, to store 
spermatozoa.
The epididymis leads to a short duct called 
ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory ducts on 
both sides join to form the genital atrium. 
The atrium consists of two regions, the coiled 
prostate glands and the penial sac consisting of 
penis that opens through the male genital pore.
Female Reproductive System 
It consists of ovaries, oviducts and vagina. 
There is a single pair of ovary in the 11th 
segment on the ventral side. Each ovary is a 
coiled ribbon-shaped structure.
The ova are budded off from the ovary. From 
each ovary runs a short oviduct. The oviducts of 
the two sides joins together, to form a common 
oviduct. The common oviduct opens into a 
pear-shaped vagina which lies mid-ventrally in 
the posterior part of the 11th segment.

 Parasitic Adaptations 
of Leech
Leeches lead a parasitic 
mode of life by sucking the 
blood of vertebrates and show 
several important adaptations 
in their structure. 
1. Blood is sucked by pharynx.
2. Anterior and posterior ends of the body are 
provided with suckers by which the animal 
attaches itself to the body of the host. 
3. The three jaws inside the mouth, causes a 
painless Y-shaped wound in the skin of the 
host.
4. The salivary glands produce hirudin which 
does not allow the blood to coagulate. Thus, a 
continuous supply of the blood is maintained.
5. Parapodia and setae are completely 
absent
6. Blood is stored in the crop. It gives 
nourishment to the leech for several months. 
Due to this reason there is no elaborate 
secretion of the digestive juices and enzymes.
Blood letting is a technique of 
bleeding in a patient to remove 
toxic impurities from the body.

Medicinal value of Leech
Leeches are effective in increasing 
blood circulation and breaking up blood 
clots. It is surprising that they can be used to 
treat cardiovascular diseases. Biochemical 
substances derived from leech saliva are 
used for preparation of pharmaceutical 
drugs that can treat hypertension.

Structural Organisation of Animals
They are distributed throughout the world. They 
are herbivorous animals feeding on grass and 
vegetables like turnips, carrots and lettuce. Rabbits 
are gregarious (moving in groups) animals 
The pygmy rabbit was listed 
as a threatened species in 
Washington in 1990, because 
of decline in its population size and 
distribution due to habitat loss. In March 
2003, the Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbit was 
federally listed as an endangered species.

Figure 13.5 Rabbit- External features
Shape, Size and Colouration: It has an 
elongated and cylindrical body. Males and 
females are of the same size. They grow about 
45 cm in length and weigh about 2.25 kg as 
adult. The colour varies from white to black 
and white. Body is covered with fur which 
serves to keep it warm. 
Body-division: The body of the rabbit is 
divisible into the head, neck, trunk and tail. 
Head: Head is ovoid, flattened and bears 
a truncate snout. It contains mouth, external 
nares, eyes, ears and vibrissae. The mouth is a 
transverse slit-like bounded by upper lip and 
lower lip. Just above the mouth are two oblique 
openings called nostrils. From each side of the 
upper lip tactile hairs or vibrissae (whiskers) 
project outwards. A pair of large, movable 
external ear or pinnae is situated at the top of 
the head.
Neck: The neck connects the head with the 
trunk. It helps to turn the head.
Trunk: The trunk is divisible into an anterior 
thorax and a posterior abdomen. In females, 
four or five teats or nipples are present on 
the ventral surface between the thorax and 
abdomen. 
The trunk bears two pairs of pentadactyl 
limbs. The forelimbs are shorter than the hind 
limbs. All the digits bear claws.
The anus is present at the posterior end 
of the abdomen at the base of tail. In females 
on the ventral side a slit like vulva is present. 
In males penis is present in the ventral side of 
anus. The male has a pair of testes enclosed by 
scrotal sacs. 
Tail: The tail is short. It is used to give signals 
to other rabbits in the event of danger.
Integument (Skin): The integument forms 
the outer covering of the body. The structures 
which are derived from it are hairs, claws, 
nails and glands like sweat glands, sebaceous 
glands and mammary glands. 
Mammary glands are modified glands 
of the skin. They secrete milk and help in 
nourishing young ones. The sweat glands 
and sebaceous glands embedded in the skin 
regulate the body temperature. 
13.2.3 Coelom (Body cavity)
Rabbit is a coelomate animal. The 
body is divisible into thoracic cavity and 
abdominal cavity separated by transverse 
partition called diaphragm. Diaphragm is the 
characteristic feature of mammals. Breathing 
movements are brought by the movement of 
the diaphragm.
Lungs and heart lie in the thoracic cavity, 
whereas, abdominal cavity encloses digestive 
and urinogenital system.

13.2.4 Digestive System
The 
digestive 
system 
includes 
the 
alimentary canal and the associated digestive 
glands. The alimentary canal consists of mouth, 
buccal cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, 
small intestine, caecum, large intestine and anus. 
Mouth is a transverse slit bounded by 
upper and lower lips. It leads into the buccal 
cavity. The floor of the buccal cavity is occupied 
by a muscular tongue. Jaws bear teeth. 
The buccal cavity leads into the oesophagus 
through the pharynx. Oesophagus opens 
into the stomach followed by small intestine. 
Caecum is a thin walled sac present at the 
junction of small intestine and large intestine. 
It contains bacteria that helps in digestion of 
cellulose. The small intestine opens into the 
large intestine which has colon and rectum. 
The rectum finally opens outside by the anus.
Digestive glands 
The digestive glands are salivary glands, 
gastric glands, liver, pancreas and intestinal 
glands. The secretions of digestive glands help 
in digestion of food in the alimentary canal. 
Dentition in Rabbit
Teeth are hard bone-like structures used 
to cut, tear and grind the food materials. The 
rabbit has two sets of teeth. The existence of 
two sets of teeth in the life of an animal is called 
diphyodont dentition. The two types of teeth 
are milk teeth (young ones) and permanent 
teeth (in adults). 
In rabbit the teeth are of different types. 
Hence, the dentition is called heterodont. There 
are four kinds of teeth in mammals viz. the 
incisors (I), canines (C), premolars (PM) and 
molars (M). This is expressed in the form of a 
dental formula.

Dental formula is the simple method 
of representing the teeth of a mammal. The 
number of each kind of tooth in the upper and 
the lower jaws on one side is counted.
Dental formula is (I  2

are absent. The gap between the incisors 
and premolar is called diastema. It helps in 
mastication and chewing of food in herbivorous 
animals.
13.2.5 Respiratory System
Respiration takes place by a pair of lungs, 
which are light spongy tissues enclosed in the 
thoracic cavity. The thoracic cavity is bound 
dorsally by the vertebral column and ventrally 
by the sternum, laterally by the ribs. On the 
lower side of the thoracic cavity is the dome 
shaped diaphragm.

Fig. 13.8 Lungs of Rabbit
Each lung is enclosed by a double 
membranous pleura. Atmospheric air passes 
through the external nostril and nasal passages 
into the pharynx. From the pharynx it passes 
through the glottis into the wind pipe. 
The anterior part of the wind pipe is 
enlarged to form the larynx or voice box with 
its wall supported by four cartilaginous plates. 
Inside the larynx lies the vocal cord and its 
vibrations result in the production of sound. 
The larynx leads into trachea or wind pipe.
Tracheal walls are supported by rings of 
cartilage which help in the free passage of air. 
The epiglottis prevents the entry of food into 
the trachea through the glottis. The trachea 
divides into two branches called the bronchi 
one entering into each lung and dividing into 
further branches called bronchioles which 
end in alveoli. 
The 
respiratory 
events 
consist 
of 
inspiration (breathing in) and expiration 
(breathing out) allowing exchange of gases 
(oxygen and carbon dioxide). Inspiration is 
an active process while expiration is a passive 
process. 
13.2.6 Circulatory System
The circulatory system is formed of blood, 
blood vessels and heart. The heart is pear shaped 
and lies in the thoracic cavity in between the 
lungs. It is enclosed by pericardium, a double 
layered membrane.

The heart is four chambered with two 
auricles and two ventricles. The right and 
left auricles are separated by interauricular 
septum, similarly right and left ventricles are 
separated by interventricular septum. 
The right auricle opens into the right 
ventricle 
by 
right 
auriculoventricular 
aperture, guarded by a tricuspid valve. The 
left auricle opens into the left ventricle by left 
auriculoventricular aperture guarded by a 
bicuspid valve or mitral valve. The opening of 
the pulmonary artery and aorta are guarded by 
three semilunar valves. 
 The right auricle receives deoxygenated 
blood through two precaval (superior vena cava) 
and one postcaval (inferior vena cava) veins 
from all parts of the body. The left auricle receives 
oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins 
from the lungs. From the right ventricle arises 
pulmonary trunk which carries the deoxygenated 
blood to the lungs and from the left ventricle 
arises the systemic arch (aorta) which supplies 
oxygenated blood to all parts of the body.
13.2.7 Nervous System
The nervous system in rabbit is formed of 
the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral 
nervous system (PNS) and autonomic nervous 
system (ANS). 
CNS consists of brain and spinal cord. PNS 
is formed of 12 pairs of cranial nerves and 37 pairs 
of spinal nerves. ANS comprises sympathetic 
and parasympathetic nerves.

Brain is situated in the cranial cavity 
and covered by three membranes called an 
outer duramater, an inner piamater and a 
middle arachnoid membrane. The brain is 
divided 
into 
forebrain 
(prosencephalon), 
midbrain (mesencephalon) and hindbrain 
(rhombencephalon). 
Forebrain consists of a pair of olfactory lobes, 
cerebral hemispheres and diencephalon. The 
right and left cerebral hemispheres are connected 
by transverse band of nerve tissue called corpus 
callosum.

The midbrain includes the optic lobes. 
The hindbrain consists of the cerebellum, pons 
varolii and medulla oblongata. You will study 
about the details of mammalian brain in the 
chapter on nervous system. 
13.2.8 Urinogenital System
It comprises the urinary or excretory 
system and the genital or reproductive system. 
Therefore, they are usually described as 
urinogenital system in vertebrates.
Excretory system
Each kidney is made of several nephrons. 
It separates the nitrogenous wastes from blood 
and excretes it in the form of urea. Kidneys 
are dark red, bean shaped organs situated in 
the abdominal cavity. From each kidney arises 
the ureters which open posteriorly into the 
urinary bladder and leads into a thick walled 
muscular duct called urethra.
Reproductive System
Sexual dimorphism is exhibited in rabbits. 
The  male and female sexes are separate and 
are morphologically different.  
Male Reproductive system
The male reproductive system of rabbit 
consists of a pair of testes which are ovoid in 
shape. Testes are enclosed by scrotal sacs in 
the abdominal cavity. Each testis consists of 
numerous fine tubules called seminiferous 
tubules. This network of tubules lead into a 
coiled tubule called epididymis, which lead 
into the sperm duct called vas deferens. The 
vas deferens join in the urethra just below the 
urinary bladder. The urethra runs backward 
and passes into the penis. 
There are three accessory glands namely 
prostate gland, cowperâ€™s gland and perineal 
gland. Their secretions are involved in 
reproduction.

ovoid structures. They are located behind the 
kidneys in the abdominal cavity.  
A pair of oviducts opens into the body 
cavity by a funnel shaped opening from each 
side of the ovary. The anterior part of the 
oviduct is the fallopian tube. It leads into a 
wider tube called the uterus. The uterus join 
together to form a median tube called vagina. 
The common tube is formed by the union of 
urinary bladder and the vagina and is called 
the urinogenital canal or vestibule. It runs 
backwards and opens to the exterior by a slit-
like aperture called vulva. 
A pair of Cowperâ€™s gland and perineal 
gland are the accessory glands present in the 
female reproductive system.
Points to Remember
 
Â™
Leech is metamerically segmented and has 
33 segments.
 
Â™
It has two suckers which are used to 
attach to the body of the host. It is also 
involved in locomotion.
 
Â™
The salivary glands of leech produce 
an anticoagulating substance called 
hirudin.
 
Â™
Leech is a hermaphrodite.
 
Â™
Rabbits are warm blooded vertebrates. 
 
Â™
Canine teeth are absent in rabbit.
 
Â™
Respiration takes place through a pair of 
lungs in rabbit.
 
Â™
The heart is four chambered consisting of 
two auricles and two ventricles. 
 
Â™
Urinogenital system comprises the 
urinary (or) excretory system and the 
genital (or) reproductive system.
 
Â™
Mammary glands are modified glands of 
the skin and help in nourishing the young 
ones.
