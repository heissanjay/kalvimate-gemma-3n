     INTRODUCTION 
Sun is the primary source of thermal 
energy for all living organisms. Thermal 
energy is the cause and temperature is the 
effect. All living organisms need a particular 
temperature for their survival. In the kitchen, 
a container with a steel bottom is placed on 
the induction stove. Do you know why? All 
of us have a common man’s understanding of 
thermal energy and temperature. But, in this 
chapter, you shall learn about thermal energy 
and temperature in a scientific manner. We 
shall also discuss about how thermal energy 
is transferred and the effects of thermal 
energy.
 3.1   TEMPERATURE
Temperature is defined as the degree 
of hotness of a body. The temperature is 
higher for a hotter body than for a colder 
body. It is also be defined as the property 
which determines whether a body is in 
equilibrium or not with the surroundings. 
(or average kinetic enegy of the molecules). 
Further, temperature is the property, which 
determines the direction of flow of heat. It is 
a scalar quantity. The SI unit of temperature 
is kelvin (K). There are other commonly 
used units of temperature such as degree 
celsius (°C) and degree fahrenheit (°F).
3.1.1  Absolute scale (kelvin scale) 
of temperature
The temperature measured in relation to 
absolute zero using the kelvin scale is known 
as absolute scale temperature. It is also known 
as the thermodynamic temperature. Each unit 
of the thermodynamic scale of temperature is 
defined as the fraction of 1/273.16th part of the 
thermodynamic temperature of the triple point 
of water. A temperature difference of 1°C is equal 
to that of 1K. Zero Kelvin is the absolute scale 
of temperature  of the body.

                                       0 K = –273°C.
3.1.2  Thermal equilibrium
Two or more physical systems or bodies are 
said to be in thermal equilibrium if there is no 
net flow of thermal energy between the systems. 
Heat energy always flows from one body to 
the other due to a temperature difference 
between them. Thus, you can define thermal 
equilibrium in another way. If two bodies are 
said to be in thermal equilibrium, then, they 
will be at the same temperature. What will 
happen if two bodies at different temperatures 
are brought in contact with one other? There 
will be a transfer of heat energy from the 
hot body to the cold body until a thermal 
equilibrium is established between them. This 
is depicted in Figure 3.1.
Figure 3.1 Establishing thermal equilibrium
When a cold body is placed in contact with 
a hot body, some thermal energy is transferred 
from the hot body to the cold body. As a result, 
there is some rise in the temperature of the cold 
body and decrease in the temperature of the 
hot body. This process will continue until these 
two bodies attain the same temperature.
 3.2  THERMAL ENERGY
If you leave a cup of hot milk on a table for 
some time, what happens? The hotness of the 
milk decreases after some time. Similarly, if you 
keep a bottle of cold water on a table, the water 
becomes warmer after some time. What do you 
infer from these observations? In the case of hot 
milk, there is a flow of energy from the cup of 
milk to the environment. In the second case, 
the energy is transferred from the environment 
to the water bottle. This energy is termed as 
“thermal energy”. 
When a hot object is in contact with 
another cold object, a form of energy flows from 
the hot object to the cold object, which is known 
as thermal energy. Thus, thermal energy is a 
form of energy which is transferred between 
any two bodies due to the difference in their 
temperatures. Thermal energy is also known as 
'heat energy' or simply 'heat'.
Heat energy is the agent, which produces 
the sensation of warmth and makes bodies hot. 
The process in which heat energy flows from a 
body at a higher temperature to another object 
at lower temperature is known as heating. This 
process of transmission of heat may be done 
in any of the ways like conduction, convection 
or radiation. Heat is a scalar quantity. The SI 
unit of heat energy absorbed or evolved is 
joule (J) . 
During the process of transferring heat 
energy, the body at lower temperature is heated 
while the body at higher temperature is cooled. 
Thus, sometimes, this process of transfer of 
heat energy is termed as 'cooling'. But, in 
most of the cases the term 'heating' is used 
instead of 'cooling'. When the thermal energy 
is transferred from one body to another, this 
results in the rise or lowering of the temperature 
of either of the bodies. 
3.2.1  Characteristic features 
of heat energy transfer
1. Heat always flows from a system at 
higher temperature to a system at lower 
temperature.
2. The mass of a system is not altered when it is 
heated or cooled.
3. For any exchange of heat, the heat gained by 
the cold system is equal to heat lost by the 
hot system.
 
Heat gained = Heat lost

3.2.2  Other units of Heat energy
Though the SI unit of heat energy is joule, 
there are some other commonly used units. 
Calorie: One calorie is defined as the amount of 
heat energy required to rise the temperature of 1 
gram of water through 1°C.
Kilocalorie: One kilocalorie is defined as the 
amount of heat energy required to rise the 
temperature of 1 kilogram of water through 1°C.
 3.3  EFFECT OF HEAT ENERGY
When a certain amount of heat energy 
is given to a substance, it will undergo one or 
more of the following changes:
• 
Temperature of the substance rises.
• 
 The substance may change its state from 
solid to liquid or from liquid to gas.
• 
The substance will expand when heated.
The rise in temperature is in proportion 
to the amount of heat energy supplied. It 
also depends on the nature and mass of the 
substance. About the rise in temperature 
and the change of state, you have studied in 
previous classes. In the following section, we 
shall discuss about the expansion of substances 
due to heat.
3.3.1  Expansion of Substances
When heat energy is supplied to a body, 
there can be an increase in the dimension of 
the object. This change in 
the dimension due to rise 
in temperature is called 
thermal expansion of the 
object. The expansion of 
liquids (e.g. mercury) can 
be seen when a thermometer is placed in 
warm water. All forms of matter (solid, liquid 
and gas) undergo expansion on heating.
a) Expansion in solids
When a solid is heated, the atoms gain 
energy and vibrate more vigorously. This results 
in the expansion of the solid. For a given change 
in temperature, the extent of expansion is smaller 
in solids than in liquids and gases. This is due to 
the rigid nature of solids. 
The different types of expansion of solid are 
listed and explained below:
1. Linear expansion
2. Superficial expansion
3. Cubical expansion
1. Linear expansion:
When a body is heated or cooled, the 
length of the body changes due to change in 
its temperature. Then the expansion is said to 
be linear or longitudinal expansion.
The ratio of increase in length of the body 
per degree rise in temperature to its unit length 
is called as the coefficient of linear expansion. 
The SI unit of Coefficient of Linear expansion is 
K-1. The value of coefficient of linear expansion 
is different for different materials.
Figure 3.2 Linear expansion
The equation relating the change in length 
and the change in temperature of a body is 
given below:

Thermal Physics
2. Superficial expansion:
If there is an increase in the area of a solid 
object due to heating, then the expansion is 
called superficial or areal expansion.
Superficial expansion  is determined in 
terms of coefficient of superficial expansion. 
The ratio of increase in area of the body per 
degree rise in temperature to its unit area is 
called as coefficient of superficial expansion. 
Coefficient of superficial expansion is different 
for different materials. The SI unit of Coefficient 
of superficial expansion is K-1
The equation relating to the changein area 
and the change in temperature is given below:

∆A -  Change in area (Final area - Initial 
area)

temperature - Initial temperature)

3. Cubical expansion:
If there is an increase in the volume of a 
solid body due to heating, then the expansion 
is called cubical or volumetric expansion.
As in the cases of linear and areal expansion, 
cubical expansion is also expressed in terms of 
coefficient of cubical expansion. The ratio of 
increase in volume of the body per degree rise 
in temperature to its unit volume is called as 
coefficient of cubical expansion. This is also 
measured in K
–1.

and the change in temperature is given below:

materials 
possess 
different 
coefficient of cubical expansion. Table 3.1 gives 
the coefficient of cubical expansion for some 
common materials.

of some materials
b) Expansion in liquids and gases
When heated, the atoms in a liquid or gas 
gain energy and are forced further apart. The 
extent of expansion varies from substance to 
substance. For a given rise in temperature, a 
liquid will have more expansion than a solid 
and a gaseous substance has the highest 
expansion when compared with the other two. 
The coefficient of cubical expansion of liquid is 
independent of temperature whereas its value 
for gases depends on the temperature of gases.

10th Standard Science
When a liquid is heated, it is done by keeping 
the liquid in some container and supplying heat 
energy to the liquid through the container. The 
thermal energy supplied will be partly used 
in expanding the container and partly used in 
expanding the liquid. Thus, what we observe 
may not be the actual or real expansion of the 
liquid. Hence, for liquids, we can define real 
expansion and apparent expansion.
1) Real expansion
If a liquid is heated directly without using 
any container, then the expansion that you observe 
is termed as real expansion of the liquid. 
Coefficient of real expansion is defined 
as the ratio of the true rise in the volume of 
the liquid per degree rise in temperature to its 
unit volume. The SI unit of coefficient of real 
expansion is K
–1.
2) Apparent expansion  
Heating a liquid without using a container 
is not possible. Thus, in practice, you can heat 
any liquid by pouring it in a container. A part 
of thermal energy is used in expanding the 
container and a part is used in expanding the 
liquid. Thus, what you observe is not the actual 
or real expansion of the liquid. The expansion 
of a liquid apparently observed without 
considering the expansion of the container is 
called the apparent expansion of the liquid. 
Coefficient of apparent expansion is 
defined as the ratio of the apparent rise in 
the volume of the liquid per degree rise in 
temperature to its unit volume. The SI unit of 
coefficient of apparent expansion is K
–1.
3.3.2  Experiment to measure real 
and apparent expansion 
of liquid
To start with, the liquid whose real and 
apparent expansion is to be determined is 
poured in a container up to a level. Mark this 
level as L1. Now, heat the container and the 
liquid using a burner as shown in the Figure 3.5. 
Initially, the container receives the thermal 
energy and it expands. As a result, the volume 
of the liquid appears to have reduced. Mark this 
reduced level of liquid as L2. 
On further heating, the thermal energy 
supplied to the liquid through the container results 
in the expansion of the liquid. Hence, the level of 
liquid rises to L3. Now, the difference between the 
levels L1 and L3 is called as apparent expansion, 
and the difference between the levels L2 and L3 
is called real expansion. The real expansion is 
always more than that of apparent expansion.
Figure 3.5 Real and apparent expansion 
of liquid
Real expansion = L3 – L2
Apparent expansion = L3 – L1
 3.4   FUNDAMENTAL LAWS 
OF GASES
The three fundamental laws which 
connect the relation between pressure, volume 
and temperature are as follows:
1) Boyle’s Law
2) Charles's law 
3) Avogadro's law
3.4.1 Boyle’s law:  
When the temperature of a 
gas is kept constant, the volume of a fixed mass 
of gas is inversely proportional to its pressure. 
This is shown in Figure 3.6.

Thermal Physics
Figure 3.6 Variation of volume with pressure
In other words, for an invariable mass 
of a perfect gas, at constant temperature, 
the product of its pressure and volume is a 
constant.
(i.e)  PV = constant
3.4.2  Charles's law  
(The law of volume)
Charles’s law was formulated by a French 
scientist Jacques Charles. According to this 
law, When the pressure of gas is kept constant, 
the volume of a gas is directly proportional to 
the temperature of the gas.
V α T
or V
 T = constant
3.4.3  Avogadro's law 
Avogadro's law states 
that at constant pressure and 
temperature, the volume of 
a gas is directly proportional 
to number of atoms or 
molecules present in it.
i.e.      V α n
(or)      V
 n = constant
Avogadro’s number (NA) is the total 
number of atoms per mole of the substance. It 
is equal to 6.023 × 10
23 /mol.
 3.5  GASES
Gases are classified as real gases and 
ideal gases.
3.5.1 Real Gases 
If the molecules or atoms of a gases 
interact with each other with a definite amount 
of intermolecular or inter atomic force of 
attraction, then the gases are said to be real 
gases. At very high temperature or low pressure, 
a real gases behaves as an ideal gases because 
in this condition there is no interatomic or 
intermolecular force of attraction.
3.5.2 Ideal Gases
If the atoms or molecules of a gas do not 
interact with each other, then the gas is said to 
be an ideal gas or a perfect gas. 
Actually, in practice, no gas is ideal. 
The molecules of any gas will have a certain 
amount of interaction among them. But, these 
interactions are weaker when the pressure 
is low or the temperature is high because 
the interatomic or intermolecular forces of 
attraction are weak in ideal gas. Hence, a real 
gas at low pressure or high temperature can be 
termed as a perfect gas.
Ideal gases obey Boyle’s law, Charles’s law 
and Avogadro’s law. All these laws state the 
relationship between various properties of a gas 
such as pressure (P), volume (V), temperature 
(T) and number of atoms (n). In a given state of 
the gas, all these parameters will have a definite 
set of values. When there is a change in the state 
of the gas, any one or more of these parameters 
change its value. The above said laws relate these 
changes.
3.5.3 Ideal Gas Equation
The ideal gas equation is an equation, 
which relates all the properties of an ideal gas. 
An ideal gas obeys Boyle’s law and Charles’ law 
and Avogadro’s law. According to Boyle’s law, 
PV = constant  
(3.1)

10th Standard Science
According to Charles’s law, 
V/T = constant  
(3.2)
According to Avogadro’s law,
V/n = constant  
 (3.3)
After combining equations (3.1), (3.2) 
and (3.3), you can get the following equation.
PV/nT = constant  
(3.4)
The above relation is called the combined 
law of gases. If you consider a gas, which 
contains µ moles of the gas, the number of 
atoms contained will be equal to µ times the 
Avogadro number, NA. 
i.e.   n = µNA.  
 
(3.5)
Using equation (3.5), equation (3.4) can 
be written as
PV/ µNAT = constant
The value of the constant in the above 
equation is taken to be kB, which is called as 
Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10–23 JK–1). Hence, 
we have the following equation:
PV/ µNAT = kB
PV = µNA kB T
Here, µNAkB = R, which is termed as 
universal gas constant whose value is 
8.31 J mol−1 K−1. 
PV = RT  
 (3.6)
Ideal gas equation is also called as equation 
of state because it gives the relation between 
the state variables and it is used to describe the 
state of any gas.
Points to Remember
 

 The SI unit of heat energy absorbed or 
evolved is joule (J)
 

 Heat always flows from a system at higher 
temperature to a system at lower temperature.
 

 Temperature is defined as the degree 
of hotness of a body. The SI unit of 
temperature is kelvin (K).
 

 All the substances will undergo one or 
more of the following changes when 
heated:
i) 
 Temperature of the substance rises.
ii)  The substance may change state from 
solid to liquid or gas.
iii)  The 
substance 
will 
expand 
when heated.
 

 All forms of matter (solid, liquid and gas) 
undergo expansion on heating.
 

 For a given rise in temperature, a liquid 
will have more expansion than a solid 
and a gaseous substance has the highest 
expansion than the other two.
 

 If a liquid is heated directly without using 
any container, then the expansion that 
you observe is termed as real expansion 
of the liquid.  
 

 The expansion of a liquid apparently 
observed 
without 
considering 
the 
expansion of the container is called the 
apparent expansion of liquid. 
 

 For a given heat energy, the real expansion 
is always more than that of apparent 
expansion.
 

 If the atoms or molecules of a gas do 
not interact with each other, then 
the gas is said to be an ideal gas or a 
perfect gas.

Thermal Physics
Data:
Level of the liquid L1 = 50 ml
Level of the liquid L2 = 48.5 ml
Level of the liquid L3 = 51.2 ml
Apparent expansion  = L3 − L1
 
 
= 51.2 ml – 50 ml 
= 1.2ml
Real expansion  = L3 − L2
 
 
= 51.2 ml – 48.5ml 
= 2.7ml
So, Real expansion > apparent expansion
