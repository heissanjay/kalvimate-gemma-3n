      Introduction 
Multicellular organisms possess millions 
of cells in their body. Every cell needs a constant 
supply of essential substances like nutrients and 
oxygen to maintain life and survival. Food is 
the only source of energy and every cell gets 
its energy by the breakdown of glucose. The 
cells utilise this energy and govern various vital 
activities of life.
Have you ever wondered how water and 
nutrients absorbed by the root are transported 
to the leaves?  How is the food prepared by the 
leaves carried to the other parts of the plant? 
Do you know how water reaches the top of tall 
plants inspite of not having a circulatory system 
like animals? Water absorbed by the roots have 
to reach entire plant and the food synthesised by 
the leaves have to be distributed to all the parts 
of the plant. To understand this we need to recall 
the anatomy of the plants. Water and mineral 
salts absorbed by the roots reach all parts of the 
plant through the xylem. The food synthesised 
by the leaves are translocated to all parts of the 
plant through the phloem. The bulk movement 
of substances through the vascular tissue is called 
Translocation.
â€˜Transportâ€™ means to carry things from 
one place to another. Have you ever wondered 
how in animals the useful substances are 
transported to other cells and toxic substances 
are removed? In larger organisms transport of 
nutrients, salts, oxygen, hormones and waste 
products around the body are performed by the 
â€˜Circulatory systemâ€™. The circulatory system 
consists of the circulating fluids, the blood and 
lymph and the heart and blood vessels which 
form the collecting and transporting system.

Transportation in Plants and Circulation in Animals
 14.1   Means of Transport 
in Plants
The transport of materials in and out of 
the cells is carried out by diffusion and active 
transport in plants.
14.1.1 Diffusion
The movement of solid liquid and gaseous 
molecules from a region of higher concentration 
to a region of their lower concentration without 
the utilization of energy is called diffusion. This 
is a passive process.
Before diffusion
After diffusion
Figure 14.1 Diffusion
14.1.2 Active Transport
Active transport utilizes energy to pump 
molecules against a concentration gradient. 
Active transport is carried out by membrane 
bound proteins. These proteins use energy to carry 
substances across the cell membrane hence they 
are often referred to as pumps. These pumps can 
transport substances from a low concentration to 
a high concentration (â€˜uphillâ€™ transport). 
14.1.3 Osmosis
Osmosis is the movement of solvent 
or water molecules from the region of 
higher concentration to the region of lower 
concentration 
through 
a 
semi-permeable 
membrane. This process is carried out till an 
equilibrium is reached. Osmosis is the passive 
movement of water or any other solvent molecules. 
Plasmolysis
It occurs when a living plant cell is placed 
in a hypertonic solution water molecule moves 
out of the cell and resulting in the shrinkage of 
protoplasm away from the cell wall.

with a semipermeable 
membrane, is filled with 
sucrose solution. It is 
kept inverted in a beaker

water will diffuse across 
the membrane due to osmosis and raise the 
level of the solution in the funnel.

Imbibition 
Imbibition is a type of diffusion in 
which a solid plant material absorbs water 
and gets swelled up. eg. absorption of water 
by dry seeds and grapes. If it were not for 
imbibition, seedlings would not have been 
able to emerge out of the soil.
 14.2   Root Hair-Water 
Absorbing Unit
There are millions of root hairs on the tip 
of the root which absorb water and minerals by 
diffusion. Root hairs are thin walled, slender 
extension of epidermal cell that increase the 
surface area of absorption.

 14.3   Pathway of Water 
Absorbed by Roots
Once the water enters the root hairs, the 
concentration of water molecules in the root 
hair cells become more than that of the cortex. 
Thus water from the root hair moves to the 
cortical cells by osmosis and then reaches the 
xylem. From there the water is transported to 
the stem and leaves.

of water from soil to xylem
 14.4   Types of Movement of 
Water into the Root Cells
Once water is absorbed by the root hairs, it 
can move deeper into root layers by two distinct 
pathways:
â€¢ 
Apoplast pathway
â€¢ 
Symplast pathway
14.4.1 Apoplast Pathway
The apoplastic movement of water occurs 
exclusively through the intercellular spaces 
and the walls of the cells. Apoplastic movement 
does not involve crossing the cell membrane. 
This movement is dependent on the gradient. 
14.4.2 Symplast Pathway
In this method, water molecules move 
to the adjacent cells, through the plasma 
membrane, cytoplasm and plasmodesmata. 
This method of transport is slow as water 
moves through plasma membrane. It is in 
accordance to the concentration gradient.

 14.5   Transpiration
Transpiration is the evaporation of water 
from the aerial parts of the plant especially 
through stomata in leaves. Stomata are open in 
the day and closed at night. The opening and 
closing of the stomata is due to the change in 
turgidity of the guard cells. When water enters 
into the guard cells, they become turgid and the 
stoma open. When the guard cells lose water, it 
becomes flaccid and the stoma closes.
Water evaporates from mesophyll cells of 
leaves through the open stomata, this lowers 
water concentration in mesophyll cells. As a 
result, more water is drawn into these cells 
from the xylem present in the veins through 
the process of osmosis. As water is lost from the 
leaves, pressure is created at the top to pull more 
water from the xylem to the mesophyll cells, this 
process is called transpiration pull. This extends 
up to the roots causing the roots to absorb more 
water from the soil to ensure continuous flow of 
water from the roots to the leaves.

Transportation in Plants and Circulation in Animals
14.5.1  Factors affecting 
Transpiration
Transpiration is affected by several external 
factors such as temperature, light, humidity, 
and wind speed. Internal factors that affect 
transpiration include number and distribution 
of stomata, percentage of open stomata, water 
status of the plant, canopy structure etc.
Significance of Transpiration
â€¢ 
Creates transpirational pull for transport of 
water
â€¢ 
Supplies water for photosynthesis
â€¢ 
Transports minerals from soil to all parts of 
the plant
â€¢ 
Cools the surface of the leaves by 
evaporation.
â€¢ 
Keeps the cells turgid; hence, maintains 
their shape
 14.6   Root Pressure
As mineral ions from the soil are actively 
transported into the xylem tissue of the root, 
water moves along and increases the pressure 
inside the xylem. This pressure is called root 
pressure and is responsible for pushing water 
upward to some extent.
 14.7   Uptake of Minerals
Plants depend on minerals from soil for its 
nutritional requirements. All minerals cannot 
be passively absorbed by the roots. Two factors 
account for this: (i) minerals are present in the 
Guard cells
(swollen)

soil as charged particles (ions) that cannot move 
across cell membranes and (ii) theÂ concentration 
of minerals in the soil is usually lower than the 
concentration of minerals in the root. Therefore, 
most minerals enter the root by active absorption 
through the cytoplasm of epidermal cells. This 
needs energy in the form of ATP. Then it is 
transported to all parts by transpiration pull.
 14.8   Translocation of Mineral 
Ions
Minerals are remobilised from older dying 
leaves to younger leaves. This phenomenon 
can be seen in deciduous plants. Elements like 
phosphorus, sulphur, nitrogen and potassium 
are easily mobilised, while elements like calcium 
are not remobilised. Small amounts of material 
exchange takes place between xylem and phloem. 
 14.9   Phloem Transport
The food synthesised by the leaves are 
transported by the phloem either to the area of 
requirement or stored. Phloem tissue is composed 
of sieve tubes which have sieve plates. Cytoplasmic 
strands pass through the pores in the sieve plates. 
Phloem transports food (sucrose) from a 
source to a sink. The source is part of the plant 
that synthesize food, i.e., the leaf, and sink, is 
the part that needs or stores the food. But, the 
source and sink may be reversed depending on 
the season, or the plantâ€™s need.
Since the source-sink relationship is 
variable, the direction of movement in the 
phloem can be upwards or downwards, i.e., 
bidirectional. In contrast, the movement is 
always unidirectional in xylem i.e., upwards.
 14.10   Translocation of Sugars
The mechanism of translocation of sugars 
from source to sink is through pressure flow 
hypothesis Glucose prepared at source (by 
10th_Science Unit-14.indd   203

10th Standard Science
photosynthesis) is converted to sucrose. Sucrose 
moves into the companion cells, then into the 
living phloem sieve tube cells by active transport. 
This process produces a hypertonic condition in 
the phloem. Water in the adjacent xylem moves 
into the phloem by osmosis. As osmotic pressure 
builds up, the phloem sap moves to areas of lower 
pressure. By active transport sucrose moves into 
the cells where it is utilised or stored.  As sugars 
are removed, the osmotic pressure decreases and 
water moves out of the phloem.
 14.11   Ascent of Sap and its 
Events â€“ An Overview
The upward movement of water and 
minerals from roots to different plant parts is 
called ascent of sap. A number of factors play 
a role in ascent of sap and it takes places in 
following steps
Ascent of sap

Figure 14.8 Ascent of Sap
1. Root Pressure: Water from soil enters the 
root hairs due to osmosis. Root pressure is 
responsible for movement of water up to the 
base of the stem.
2. Capillary Action:  Water or any liquid rises 
in a capillary tube because of physical forces, 
this phenomenon is called capillary action. 
InÂ the same way, in stem water rises up to 
certain height because of capillary action.
3. Adhesion-cohesion of Water Molecules: 
Water molecules form a continuous column 
in the xylem because of forces of adhesion 
and cohesion among the molecules. 
4. Cohesion: The force of attraction between 
molecules of water is called cohesion.
5. Adhesion: The force of attraction between 
molecules of different substances is called 
adhesion.Water molecules stick to a xylem 
because of force of adhesion.
Transpiration Pull: Transpiration through 
stomata creates vacuum which creates a suction. 
called transpiration pull. The transpiration pull 
sucks the water column from the xylem tubes 
and thus water is able to rise to great heights 
even in the tallest plants.
 Activity 2
Demonstration of Root Pressure 
Choose a small soft stemed plant. Cut the 
stem horizontally near the base with a 
blade in the morning. You will see drops of 
solution oozing out of the cut stem due to 
root pressure.
 14.12   Blood
Blood is the main circulatory medium 
in the human body. It is a red coloured fluid 
connective tissue. 
Components of Blood: The blood consists 
of two main components. The fluid plasma 
and the formed elements (blood cells) which 
are found suspended in the plasma.
More to Know
Dews like water droplets on the leaves of grass 
seen in the early mornings, when the climate 
is humid and excess of water is present in the 
plants, the excess water is exudated in the form 
of liquid. This is due to root pressure .This 
phenomenon is called Guttation which 
takes place through specialized cells called 
Hydathodes.

Plasma: It is slightly alkaline, containing 
non-cellular substance which constitutes about 
55% of the blood. Organic substances like 
proteins, glucose, urea, enzymes, hormones, 
vitamins and minerals are present in the 
plasma.
Formed Elements of Blood: Blood 
corpuscles are of three types
1. Red 
blood 
corpuscles 
(RBC) 
or 
Erythrocytes
2. White 
blood 
corpuscles 
(WBC) 
or 
Leucocytes
3. Blood platelets or Thrombocytes.
 Red blood corpuscles (Erythrocytes)
They 
are 
the 
most 
abundant cells in the human 
body. RBCs are formed in 
the bone marrow. The RBCs 
impart red colour to the 
blood due to presence of respiratory pigment 
haemoglobin. Matured mammalian RBCs do 
not have cell organelles and nucleus. They are 
biconcave and disc-shaped. Their life span 
is about 120 days. RBC is involved in the 
transport of oxygen from lungs to tissues.
Why does mammalian RBC lack 
cell organelles and nucleus?
Mammalian 
RBC 
lack 
nucleus and makes the cells biconcave and 
increase surface area for oxygen binding, 
loss of mitochondria allows the RBC to 
transport all the oxygen to tissues, and loss 
of endoplasmic reticulum allows more 
flexibility for RBC to move through the 
narrow capillaries.
White blood corpuscles (Leucocytes)
WBC's are colourless. They do not have 
haemoglobin and are nucleated cells. It is found 
in the bone marrow, spleen, thymus and lymph 
nodes. They are capable of amoeboid movement
Erythrocytes
The white blood corpuscles can be 
grouped into two categories:
1. Granulocytes 2. Agranulocytes.
Granulocytes
They contain granules in their cytoplasm. 
Their nucleus is irregular or lobed. The 
granulocytes are of three types
 
(i) Neutrophils  (ii) Eosinophils
 
(iii) Basophils
 (i) Neutrophils 
They are large in size and have a 2 - 7 lobed 
nucleus. These corpuscles form 60% - 65% of the 
total leucocytes. Their numbers are increased 
during infection and inflammation.
(ii) Eosinophils 
It has a bilobed nucleus and constitute 
2% - 3% of the total leucocytes. Their number 
increases 
during 
conditions 
of 
allergy 
and parasitic infections. It brings about 
detoxification of toxins.
(iii) Basophils
Basophils have lobed nucleus. They form 
0.5-1.0% of the total leucocytes. They release 
chemicals during the process of inflammation.
Agranulocytes
Granules are not found in the cytoplasm of 
these cells. The agranulocytes are of two types:
(i) Lymphocytes (ii) Monocytes

206
10th Standard Science
(i) Lymphocytes
These are about 20-25% of the total leucocytes. 
They produce antibodies during bacterial and 
viral infections.
(ii) Monocytes
They are the largest of the leucocytes and are 
amoeboid in shape. These cells form 5 - 6 % of 
the total leucocytes.They are phagocytic and 
can engulf bacteria.
Blood Platelets or Thrombocytes 
These are small and 
colourless. They do not 
have nucleus. There are 
about 2,50,000 â€“ 4,00,000 
platelets / cubic mm 
of blood. Life span of 
platelets is 8â€“10 days. They play an important 
role in clotting of blood. Platelets form clot at the 
site of injury and prevent blood loss. 
More to Know
Anaemia: Decrease in number of erythrocytes.
Leucocytosis: Increase in the number of 
leukocytes.
Leukopenia: Decrease in number of 
leukocytes. 
Thrombocytopenia: Decrease in the 
number of thrombocytes.
Functions of blood
i)  Transport of respiratory gases (Oxygen 
and CO2).
ii)  Transport of digested food materials to the 
different body cells.
iii)  Transport of hormones. 
iv)  Transport 
of 
nitrogenous 
excretory 
products like ammonia, urea and uric acid.
v)  It is involved in protection of the body and 
defense against diseases.
vi)  It acts as buffer and also helps in regulation 
of pH and body temperature.
vii)  It maintains proper water balance in the 
body.
Thrombocytes
 14.13   Blood Vessels -  
Arteries and Veins
Blood vessels are a network of branched 
tubes that transport blood. There are three 
types of blood vessels namely arteries, veins 
and capillaries 
Arteries: They are thick and elastic vessels 
that carry blood away from the heart to various 
organs of the body. All arteries carry oxygenated 
blood except the pulmonary artery which carry 
deoxygenated blood to the lungs.
Veins: Veins are thin and non-elastic vessels 
that transport blood to the heart from the 
different organs. All veins carry deoxygenated 
blood except the pulmonary vein which carry 
oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. 
Capillaries: Capillaries are narrow tubes 
formed by branching of arterioles which then 
unite to form the venules and veins. They are 
about 8 Âµm in diameter. Capillaries are formed 
of single layer of endothelial cells.

 14.14   Types of Circulatory 
System
Animals possess two types of circulatory 
system. They are
1. Open type
2. Closed type
Open type
In open type the blood is pumped by heart 
into blood vessels that open into blood spaces 
called as sinuses. These sinuses are the body 
cavities which are called haemocoel. Capillary 
system is absent. e.g. Arthropods, Molluscs 
and Ascidians.
Closed type
In closed type the blood flows in a complete 
circuit around the body through specific blood 
vessels. The blood flows from arteries to veins 
through small blood vessels called capillaries. 
e.g Vertebrates.
More to Know
Closed circulatory system was discovered by 
William Harvey (1628) who is regarded the 
Father of Modern Physiology.
 14.15  Structure of Human Heart
Heart is a muscular pumping organ that 
pumps out the blood into the blood vessels. 
Human heart is situated between the lungs, 
slightly tilted toward the left and above the 
diaphragm in the thoracic cavity. The heart is 
made of specialized type of muscle called the 
cardiac muscle.
The heart is enclosed in a double walled 
sac called pericardium. It contains lubricating 
pericardial fluid which reduces friction during 
heart beat and protects it from mechanical injuries.

The human heart is four chambered. The 
two upper thin walled chambers of the heart 
are called auricle or atria (sing: atrium) and 
two lower thick walled chambers are called 
ventricles. The chambers are separated by 
partition called septum. The septum between 
auricles and ventricles prevents the mixing of 
oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. 
The two auricles are separated from each 
other by interatrial septum.The left atrium is 
smaller than the right atrium. The right atrium 
receives deoxygenated blood from different parts 
of the body through the main veins superior 
vena cava, inferior vena cava and coronary 
sinus. Pulmonary veins bring oxygenated 
blood to the left atrium from the lungs. The right 
and left auricles pump blood into the right and 
left ventricles respectively.
The ventricles form the lower part of the 
heart. The two ventricles are separated from 
each other by an interventricular septum. The 
left and right ventricles have thick walls because 
the ventricles have to pump out blood with force 
away from the heart. From the right ventricle

arises  the pulmonary trunk which bifurcates to 
form right and left pulmonary arteries. The right 
and left pulmonary arteries supply deoxygenated 
blood to the lungs of the respective side. The left 
ventricle is longer and narrower than the right 
ventricle. The walls are about three times thicker 
than the right ventricle. The left ventricle gives 
rise to aorta. The oxygenated blood is supplied 
by the aorta to various organs of the body. The 
coronary arteries supply blood to the heart.

Valves: The valves are the muscular flaps 
that regulate the flow of blood in a single 
direction and prevent back flow of blood. The 
heart contains three types of valves.
Right atrioventricular valve: It is located 
between the right auricle and right ventricle. 
It has three thin triangular leaf like flaps and 
therefore called tricuspid valve. The apices of the 
flaps are held in position by chordae tendinae 
arising from the muscular projection of the 
ventricle wall known as papillary muscles.
Left atrioventricular valve: It is located 
between the left auricle and left ventricle. It 
has two cusps and therefore called bicuspid or 
mitral valve.
Semilunar valves: The major arteries 
(pulmonary artery and aorta) which leave the 
heart have semilunar valves which prevent 
backward flow of blood into the ventricles. They 
are the pulmonary and aortic semilunar valves. 
14.15.1 Types of Blood Circulation
The blood circulates in 
our body as oxygenated and 
deoxygenated blood. The 
types of circulation are: 
i 
Systemic 
circulation: 
Circulation 
of 
oxygenated blood from the left ventricle of 
the heart to various organs of the body and 
return of deoxygenated blood to the right 
atrium. Aorta carries oxygenated blood to 
all the organs of the body.
ii Pulmonary circulation: The path of 
pulmonary circulation starts in the right 
ventricle. Pulmonary artery arises from 
the right ventricle and reaches the lungs 
with deoxygenated blood. Pulmonary 
veins collect the oxygenated blood from 
the lungs and supplies it to the left atrium 
of the heart.
iii Coronary circulation: The supply of 
blood to the heart muscles (cardiac 
muscles) 
is 
called 
as 
coronary 
circulation. Cardiac muscles receive 
oxygenated 
blood 
from 
coronary 
arteries that originate from the aortic 
arch. Deoxygenated blood from the 
cardiac muscles drains into the right 
atrium by the coronary sinuses.
When the blood circulates twice through 
the heart in one complete cycle it is called 
double circulation. In double circulation 
the oxygenated blood do not mix with the 
deoxygenated blood. 
However, in some animals the oxygenated 
and deoxygenated blood are mixed and pass 
through the heart only once. This type of 
circulation is called single circulation. e.g., 
fishes, amphibians and certain reptiles.

14.15.2 Heart Beat
One complete contraction (systole) 
and relaxation (diastole) of the atrium and 
ventricles of the heart constitute heartbeat. The 
heart normally beats 72 â€“ 75 times per minute.
More to Know
Neurogenic and Myogenic Heart Beat 
Neurogenic heart beat is initiated by a 
nerve impulse caused from a nerve ganglion 
situated near the heart. e.g. Annelids, most 
arthropods 
Myogenic heart beat is initiated by a 
specialized group of modified heart muscle 
fibres. e.g. Mollusca and Vertebrates 
Initiation and conduction of Heart beat 
The human heart is myogenic in nature. 
Contraction is initiated by a specialized portion 
of the heart muscle, the sino-atrial (SA) node 
which is situated in the wall of the right atrium 
near the opening of the superior vena cava. 
The SA node is broader at the top and tapering 
below. It is made up of thin fibres.
 Sino-atrial node acts as the â€˜pacemakerâ€™ of 
the heart because it is capable of initiating 
impulse which can stimulate the heart muscles 
to contract. The impulse from the sinoatrial 
node spreads as a wave of contraction over the 
right and left atrial wall pushing the blood 
through the atrioventricular valves into the 
ventricles. The wave of contraction from SA 
node reaches the atrioventricular (AV) node 
which is stimulated to emit an impulse of 
contraction spreading to the ventricular muscle 
via the atrioventricular bundle and the 
Purkinje fibres.
Pulse: When the heart beats the blood is 
forced into the arteries. The expansion of the 
artery every time the blood is forced into it is 
called pulse. It can be felt by placing the fingertip 
on the artery near the wrist. Normal pulse rate 
ranges from 70 â€“ 90 / min. 
Atrioventricular 
bundle 
was discovered by His (1893). 
So is called Bundle of His.

Determining Heart Rate
Materials :
Stop watch or Stop clock.
Procedure:
1. Have your partner to find the pulse in 
your wrist and count your heartbeats for 
15 seconds while you are seated.  Calculate 
your resting heart rate in beats per minute.
2. Have your partner to  count your heart 
beats for 15 seconds after you jog or run 
for 5 minutes. Calculate your heart rate in 
beats per minute.
Analyse:
â€¢ 
What causes your pulse ?
â€¢ 
What causes the change in your heart beat 
rate in each situation ?
14.15.3 Cardiac Cycle
The sequence of events occurring from 
the beginning to the completion of one heart 
beat is called cardiac cycle. During cardiac cycle 
blood flows through the chambers of the heart 
in a specific direction. Each cardiac cycle lasts 
about 0.8 second. The events during a single 
cardiac cycle involves 
(a)  Atrial systole: Contraction of auricles 
(0.1 sec)
(b)  Ventricular 
systole: 
Contraction 
of 
ventricles (0.3 sec)
(c)  Ventricular 
diastole: 
Relaxation 
of 
ventricles (0.4 sec)
Ventricular

14.15.4 Heart Sound
The rhythmic closure and opening of the 
valves cause the sound of the heart. 
The first sound LUBB is of longer duration 
and is produced by the closure of the tricuspid 
and bicuspid valves after the beginning of 
ventricular systole. The second sound DUPP is of 
a shorter duration and produced by the closure of 
semilunar valves at the end of ventricular systole. 
 14.16  Blood pressure
Blood pressure is the force exerted during 
the flow of blood against the lateral walls of 
arteries. The blood pressure is high in the 
arteries gradually drops in the arterioles and 
capillaries and become very low in the veins. 
Blood pressure is usually expressed in terms 
of the systolic pressure and diastolic pressure. 
Systolic pressure: During ventricular 
systole, the left ventricle contracts and forces 
blood into the aorta. The pressure rises to a peak 
which is referred as systolic pressure. 
Diastolic pressure: During diastole, the 
ventricles relax and the pressure falls to the 
lowest value which is referred as diastolic 
pressure.
In an healthy adult during normal resting 
condition systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
is expressed as 120mm / 80mm Hg. Blood 
pressure varies during conditions of physical 
exercise, anxiety, emotions, stress and sleep.
A prolonged or constant elevation of 
blood pressure is a condition known as 
hypertension (High blood pressure) can 
increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. 
Decrease in blood pressure is termed 
hypotension (Low blood pressure). 
Stethoscope
A stethoscope is used to detect the sound 
produced by the internal organs of human 
body. The heart sound is heard by placing the

Transportation in Plants and Circulation in Animals
Human blood contains certain specific 
substances called agglutinogens or antigens 
(Ag) and agglutinins or antibodies (Ab). 
Antigens are found on the membrane surface of 
RBC. Antibodies are present in blood plasma. 
Based on the presence or absence of antigen 
and antibodies human blood group is classified 
into four groups called A, B, AB and O. An 
individual has one of the four blood groups.
(i) â€˜Aâ€™ group individuals: Antigen A is present 
on the surface of RBC and antibody b 
(anti-b) is present in the plasma.
(ii) â€˜Bâ€™ group individuals: Antigen B is present 
on the surface of RBC and antibody a 
(antiÂ - a) is present in the plasma.
(iii) â€˜ABâ€™ group individuals: Antigens A and B 
are present on the surface of RBC and  both 
the antibodies are absent in the plasma. 
(iv) â€˜Oâ€™ group individuals: Antigen A or B are 
absent on the surface of RBC. However, 
the plasma contains both the antibodies a 
and b (anti a and b). 
Blood donation
In blood transfusion one must consider the 
antigen and antibody compatibility (matching) 
between the donor and the person receiving 
blood (recipient). When an individual receives 
a mismatched blood group from the donor 
agglutination (clumping) of blood occurs in 
the body which leads to death. 
Persons with â€˜ABâ€™ blood group are called 
â€˜Universal Recipientâ€™ as they can receive 
blood from persons with any blood group. 
Persons with â€˜Oâ€™ blood group are called 
â€˜Universal Donorâ€™ as they can donate blood 
to persons with any blood group.
Rh factor
Rh factor was discovered by Landsteiner 
and Wiener in 1940 in Rhesus monkey. The 
surface of RBC contains the antigen for Rh 
factor. Rh+ ( positive) persons have Rh antigen 
on the surface of RBC while, Rhâ€“ (negative) 
stethoscope on the chest. It is a useful diagnostic 
tool to identify and localize health problems 
and diagnose disease. The modern electronic 
stethoscopes are high precisioned instruments. 
Figure 14.14 Stethoscope
Sphygmomanometer
Sphygmomanometer is a clinical instrument 
used to measure blood pressure when a person is 
in a relaxed and resting condition. The pressure 
of the brachial artery is measured. It helps to 
estimate the state of blood circulation and 
the working of the heart. It helps to diagnose 
conditions such as increased or decreased blood 
pressure. Monometric and modern digital types 
are the apparatus used to measure blood pressure.

 14.17  Blood Groups
The concept of blood grouping was 
developed by Karl Landsteiner (1900). He 
identified blood groups A, B and O. AB blood 
group was recognized by Decastello and Sturli 
(1902).

persons do not have Rh antigen on the surface 
of RBC. Antibodies developed against this Rh 
antigen is called Rh antibodies.
 14.18  Lymphatic System
The lymphatic system comprises of 
lymphatic capillaries, lymphatic vessels, lymph 
nodes and lymphatic ducts. Lymph is the fluid 
that flows through the lymphatic system.
The lymphatic capillaries unite to form 
large lymphatic vessels. Lymph nodes are 
small oval or pear shaped structures located 
along the length of lymphatic vessels.

Lymph
Lymph from the intercellular spaces 
drains into lymphatic capillaries. Lymph is a 
colourless fluid formed when plasma, proteins 
and blood cells escape into intercellular spaces 
in the tissues through the pores present in the 
walls of capillaries. It is similar to blood plasma, 
but is colourless and contains less proteins.The 
lymph contains very small amount of nutrients, 
oxygen, CO2, water and WBC.
Functions of Lymph
 â€¢
Supplies nutrients and oxygen to those 
parts where blood cannot reach
 â€¢
It drains away excess tissue fluid and 
metabolites and returns proteins to the 
blood from tissue spaces.
 â€¢
The lymph also carries absorbed fats from 
small intestine to the blood. The lymphatic 
capillaries of intestinal villi (lacteals) 
absorb digested fats.
 â€¢
Lymphocytes in the lymph defend the body 
from infections. 
Points to Remember
 
Â™
The movement of molecules from a region 
of higher concentration to a region of 
their lower concentration without the 
utilization of energy is called diffusion.
 
Â™
Osmosis is the movement of solvent or 
water molecules from the region of higher 
concentration to the region of lower 
concentration through a semi-permeable 
membrane.
 
Â™
Transpiration is the evaporation of 
water in plants through stomata in the 
leaves.
 
Â™
The circulatory system consists of the 
circulating fluids, the blood and lymph 
and the heart and its blood vessels.

Â™
The blood consists of two main 
components. The fluid plasma and the 
formed elements (blood cells) which are 
found suspended in the plasma.
 
Â™
A muscular pumping organ that pumps 
out the blood into the blood vessels is 
called heart. 
 
Â™
The blood circulates in our body as 
oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. 
 
Â™
The supply of blood to the heart muscles 
(cardiac muscles) is called as coronary 
circulation.
 
Â™
One complete contraction (systole) 
and relaxation (diastole) of atrium and 
ventricles of heart is called a heartbeat.
 
Â™
The sequence of events which occur 
during the beginning and completion of 
one heart beat is called cardiac cycle.
 
Â™
Blood pressure is usually expressed as 
systolic pressure and diastolic pressure 
(120mm / 80 mm Hg)
 
Â™
An individual has one of the four blood 
groups A, B, AB and O.
