      Introduction 
Plants exhibits varying degrees of 
organization. 
Atoms 
are 
organized 
into 
molecules, molecules into organelles, organelles 
into cells, cells into tissues and tissues into 
organs. The first account of internal structure 
of plants was published by English Physician 
Nehemiah Grew. He is known as Father of 
Plant Anatomy. Plant anatomy (Gk Ana = as 
under; Temnein = to cut) is the study of internal 
structure of plants. You have already studied the 
different kinds of tissues in standard IX. In this 
lesson, you will study about the internal structure 
of plant tissues, process of photosynthesis and 
respiration.
 12.1   Tissues
Tissues are the group of cells that are 
similar or dissimilar in structure and origin, 
but perform similar function. Plant tissues 
can be broadly classified into two, based on 
their ability to divide. They are
i)  Meristamatic tissue
ii) Permanent tissue.
12.2  Tissue system
Sachs (1875) classified tissue system in 
plants into three types
i)   Dermal or Epidermal tissue system
ii)  Ground tissue system
iii) Vascular tissue system
The functions of these tissues are given in 
Table 12.1.
12.2.1  Dermal or Epidermal 
Tissue System
It consists of epidermis, stomata and 
epidermal outgrowths. Epidermis is the outer 
most layer. Minute pores called stomata are 
present in the epidermis of leaf and stem.

Cuticle is present on the outer wall of epidermis to 
check evaporation of water. Trichomes and root 
hairs are the epidermal outgrowths. 
Functions:
i) 
Epidermis protects the inner tissues.
ii) Stomata helps in transpiration.
iii)  Root hairs help in absorption of water and 
minerals.
12.2.2 Ground Tissue System
It includes all the tissues of the plant 
body except epidermal and vascular tissues 
like (i) Cortex (ii) Endodermis (iii) Pericycle 
(iv) Pith
12.2.3 Vascular Tissue System
It consists of xylem and phloem tissues. 
They are present in the form of bundles called 
vascular bundles. Xylem conducts water and 
minerals to different parts of the plant. Phloem 
conducts food materials to different parts of 
the plant.
There are three different types of vascular 
bundles namely (i) Radial (ii) Conjoint 
(iii) Concentric
(i) Radial Bundles
Xylem and phloem are present in different 
radii alternating with each other. e.g. roots
(ii) Conjoint bundles
Xylem and phloem lie on the same radius. 
There are two types of conjoint bundles.
a) Collateral
Xylem lies towards the centre and phloem 
lies towards the periphery. 
When cambium is present in collateral 
bundles, it is called open. e.g. dicot stem and 
collateral bundle without cambium is called 
closed. e.g. monocot stem.
b)  Bicollateral
In this type of bundle, the phloem is 
present on both outer and inner side of xylem. 
e.g. Cucurbita
(iii) Concentric Bundles
Vascular bundle in which xylem completely 
surrounds the phloem or viceversa is called 
concentric vascular bundle. It is of two types:
1.  Amphivasal: Xylem surrounds phloem. 
e.g. Dracaena
2.  Amphicribral: Phloem surrounds xylem. 
e.g. Ferns
Endarch: Protoxylem lies towards the centre 
and metaxylem lies towards the periphery. e.g. 
stem.
Exarch : Protoxylem lies towards the periphery 
and metaxylem lies towards the centre. e.g.  roots.

Cuticle and stomata are absent. Unicellular 
root hairs are present. It is also known as 
Rhizodermis or Piliferous layer. 
(ii) Cortex: It is a multilayered large zone 
made of thin-walled parenchymatous cells with 
intercellular spaces. It stores food and water.
(iii) Endodermis: It is the innermost layer 
of cortex. The cells are barrel - shaped, closely 
packed, and show band like thickenings on 
their radial and inner tangential walls called 
casparian strips. But these casparian strips are 
absent in the endodermis cells which are located 
opposite the protoxylem these thin walled cells 
without casparian strips are called passage cell. 
It helps in the movement of water and dissolved 
salts from cortex into xylem.

5. Formation of chloroplasts
12.9.4 Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis (Photo 
= light; synthesis = to 
build) is a process by which 
autotrophic organisms like 
green 
plants, 
algae 
and 
chlorophyll 
containing 
bacteria utilize the energy from sunlight to 
synthesize their own food. In this process, 
carbon dioxide combines with water in the 
presence of sunlight and chlorophyll to form 
carbohydrates. During this process oxygen is 
released as a byproduct.

12.9.5  Where does 
photosynthesis occur?
Photosynthesis occurs in all green parts of 
the plant especially in green leaves.
12.9.6 Photosynthetic Pigments
Pigments involved in photosynthesis 
are 
called 
Photosynthetic 
pigments. 
Photosynthetic pigments are of two classes 
namely, the primary pigments and accessory 
pigments. Chlorophyll a is the primary 
pigment that traps solar energy and converts 
it into electrical and chemical energy. Thus it 
is called the reaction centre. Other pigments 
such as chlorophyll b and carotenoids are 
called accessory pigments as they pass on 
the absorbed energy to chlorophyll a (Chl.a) 
molecule. Reaction centre (Primary pigments)
and harvesting centre (Accessary pigments) 
together form photo systems.
12.9.7  Role of Sunlight in 
Photosynthesis
The entire process of photosynthesis takes 
place inside the chloroplast. The structure of 
chloroplast is such that the light dependent 
(Light reaction) and light independent (Dark 
reaction) take place at different sites in the 
organelle
1.  Light dependent Reaction (Hill reaction 
\ Light reaction)
This was discovered by Robin Hill (1939). 
This reaction takes place in the presence of 
light energy in thylakoid membranes (grana) 
of the chloroplasts. Photosynthetic pigments 
absorb the light energy and convert it into 
chemical energy ATP and NADPH+H+. These 
products of light reaction move out from the 
thylakoid to the stroma of the chloroplast.

A cell cannot get its energy 
directly from glucose. So 
in respiration the energy 
released from glucose is used to make ATP 
(Adenosine Triphosphate)
2.  Light independent reactions (Dark reaction) 
(Biosynthetic phase)
Dark reaction or biosynthetic pathway is 
takes place in stroma. During this reaction CO2 
is reduced into carbohydrates with the help of 
light generated ATP and NADPH+H+. This is 
also called as Calvin cycle and is carried out in 
the absence of light. It is called dark reaction.

 12.10  Mitochondria
Mitochondria 
are 
filamentous 
or 
granular cytoplasmic organelles present in 
cells. The mitochondria were first discovered 
by Kolliker in 1857 as granular structures in 
striated muscles. Mitochondria (singular: 
mitochondrion) 
are 
organelles 
within 
eukaryotic cells that produce adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) which form the energy 
currency of the cell, for this reason, the 
mitochondria is referred to as the “Power 
house of the cell”. Mitochondria vary in size 
from 0.5 µm to 2.0 µm. Mitochondria contain 
60-70% protein, 25-30% lipids, 5-7% RNA and 
small amount of DNA and minerals. 
12.10.1  Structure of Mitochondria
Mitochondrial Membranes: It consists 
two membranes called inner and outer 
membrane. Each membrane is 60-70 A˚ thick. 
Outer mitochondrial membrane is smooth 
and freely permeable to most small molecules. 
It contains enzymes, proteins and lipids. It 
has porin molecules (proteins) which form 
channels for passage of molecules through it.
Figure 12.10 Structure of Mitochondria
Oxysome
Inner mitochondrial membrane is semi 
permeable membrane and regulates the passage 
of materials into and out of the mitochondria. 
It is rich in enzymes and carrier proteins. It 
consists of 80% proteins and lipids.

Cristae: 
The 
inner 
mitochondrial 
membrane gives rise to finger like projections 
called cristae. These cristae increase the inner 
surface area (fold in inner membrane) of the 
mitochondria to hold variety of enzymes.
Oxysomes: The inner mitochondrial 
membrane bear minute regularly spaced tennis 
racket shaped particles known as oxysomes 
(F1 particle). They involve in ATP synthesis.

12.10.2  Functions of Mitochondria
• 
Mitochondria is the main organelle of cell 
respiration. They produce a large number 
of ATP molecules. So they are called as 
power houses of the cell or ATP factory 
of the cell.
• 
It helps the cells to maintain normal 
concentration of calcium ions.
• 
It regulates the metabolic activity of the cell.
12.11   TYPES OF RESPIRATION
Respiration involves exchange of gases 
between the organism and the external 
environment. The plants obtain oxygen from 
their environment and release carbon dioxide 
and water vapour. This exchange of gases is 
known as external respiration. It is a physical 
process. Biochemical process occurs within 
cells where the food is oxidized to obtain 
energy, this is known as cellular respiration
12.11.1 Aerobic respiration
Aerobic respiration is the type of celluar 
respiration in which organic food is completely 
oxidized with the help of oxygen into carbon 
dioxide, water and energy. It occurs in most 
plants and animals.
C6H12O6  +  6O2  → 6CO2 + 6H2O + ATP
Stages of Aerobic respiration
a. Glycolysis (Glucose splitting): It is 
the breakdown of one molecule of glucose 
(6 carbon) into two molecules of pyruvic acid 
(3 carbon). Glycolysis takes place in cytoplasm 
of the cell. It is the first step of both aerobic and 
anerobic respiration.
b. Krebs Cycle: This cycle occurs in 
mitochondria matrix. At the end of glycolysis, 
2 molecules of pyruvic acid enter into 
mitochondria. The oxidation of pyruvic acid into 
CO2 and water takes place through this cycle. It is 
also called Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle (TCA).
c. Electron Transport Chain: This is 
accomplished through a system of electron 
carrier complex called electron transport 
chain (ETC) located on the inner membrane 
of the mitochondria. NADH+H+
 and FADH2 
molecules formed during glycolysis and Krebs 
cycle are oxidised to NAD+ and FAD to release 
the energy via electrons. The electrons, as they 
move through the system, release  energy which 
is trapped by ADP to synthesize ATP. This 
is called oxidative phosphorylation. In this

process, O2 the ultimate acceptor of electrons 
gets reduced to water.
12.11.2 Anaerobic respiration
Anaerobic respiration takes place without 
oxygen. Glucose is converted into ethanol 
(Ethanol fermentation by yeast) or lactic acid 
(lactic acid fermentation by bacteria).
C6H12O6 → 2CO2 + 2C2H5OH + Energy (ATP)
12.11.3  Respiratory quotient 
(R.Q)
Respiratory quotient is the ratio of volume 
of carbon dioxide liberated and the volume 
of oxygen consumed during respiration. It is 
expressed as
RQ = Volume of CO2 liberated
          Volume of O2 consumed
Points to Remember
 

Tissue is a group of similar or dissimilar 
cells, having a common orgin and 
performing similar functions.
 

Plants are capable of synthesizing glucose 
from CO2 and H2O in the presence of light, 
by the process of photosynthesis.
 

Light reaction takes place in grana of 
chloroplast.
 

Dark reaction takes place in stroma of 
chloroplast.
 

Respiration involves both external and 
cellular respiration.
 

Aerobic respiration takes place in the 
presence of oxygen.
 

Aerobic respiration occurs in three major 
steps like Glycolysis, Krebs cycle and 
Electron transport chain.
