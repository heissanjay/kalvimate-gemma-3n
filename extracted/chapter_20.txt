      Introduction 
India’s population is likely to reach 1.7 
billion by 2050. Current rate of India’s food 
production will be able to meet only 59% of 
the country’s food demand at that time. How 
can India feed 1.7 billion people by 2050? This 
can be made possible by ‘Plant breeding’ and 
‘Animal husbandry’. 
Plant breeding is the art of developing 
economically important plants with superior 
quality. 
Animal husbandry involves the breeding of 
animals. It aims at improving the genotypes of 
animals to make them more useful to the welfare 
of mankind.This emphasizes domestication 
and propagation of animals,under controlled 
conditions to enhance food production and 
food quality. 
Another breakthrough was the emergence 
of biotechnology as an entity of modern biology, 
which paved way to develop advanced healthcare 
products, diagnostic kits and food production to 
improve the quality of human life.
 20.1   Modern Agricultural 
Practices and Crop 
Improvement
Modern 
agricultural 
practices 
are 
activities carried out to improve cultivation of 
plants. It includes preparation of soil, sowing, 
application of manures and fertilizers, proper 
irrigation, protection from weeds and pests 
harvesting, threshing and storage. 
The aim of crop improvement is to 
develop improved crop varieties possesing 
higher yield, better quality, resistance to 
diseases and shorter duration.

yielding crop varieties and modern agricultural 
techniques in underdeveloped and developing 
nations. Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, an American 
agronomist the “Father of the Green 
Revolution”, received the Nobel Peace Prize in 
1970. In India Dr. M. S. Swaminathan joined 
with Dr.Borlaug in bringing Green Revolution 
by introducing Mexican wheat varieties. This 
eventually increased wheat and rice production 
between 1960 and 2000.
20.2.1  Breeding for high yield 
and better quality
Major challenge that India faced during 
post-independance 
period 
was 
having 
enough food production for the growing 
population. Efforts were taken to develop 
high yielding varieties of crops, leading to 
Green Revolution. 
Semi-Dwarf varieties in Wheat and Rice
Sonalika, Kalyan Sona are semi-dwarf 
varieties of wheat developed from high-
yielding, semi-dwarf, fertilizer responsive 
wheat varieties from Mexico. IR-8  (Miracle 
rice) is a high-yielding semi-dwarf rice variety 
developed by International Rice Research 
Institute (IRRI),Philippines. In 1966, this was 
first introduced in Philippines and India.  It 
was a hybrid of a high yielding rice variety

20.2.2  Plant Breeding for 
Disease Resistance
Plant diseases are caused by pathogens like 
viruses, bacteria and fungi. This affects crop 
yield. Hence, it is important to develop disease 
resistant varieties of crops, that would increase 
the yield and reduce the use of fungicides and 
bactericides. Some disease resistant varieties 
developed by plant breeding are given below:

20.2.4  Plant Breeding for Improved 
Nutritional Quality
Undernutrition and protein malnutrition 
among human population is a major health 
problem which has been receiving much focus 
throughout the world. Apart, from humans it also 
affects the health of farm animals. To combat these 
conditions, human and animal health are to be 
determined by the nutritional quality of the feed 
crops. The nutritional quality of crops depends on 
quality and quantity of nutrients.The nutritional 
quality may be improved with respect to its 
1. Protein content and quality of protein
2. Oil content 
3. Mineral content
Biofortification
Biofortification is the scientific process 
of developing crop plants enriched with high 
levels of desirable nutrients like vitamins, 
proteins and minerals. Some examples of crop 
varieties developed as a result of biofortification 
are given below:
1. Protina, Shakti and Rathna are lysine rich 
maize hybrids (developed in India).

 20.3   Methods of Plant 
Breeding for Crop 
Improvement
Methods of plant breeding to develop 
high yielding varieties are given below:
1. Introduction of new varieties of plants
2. Selection
3. Polyploidy breeding 
4. Mutation breeding 
5. Hybridization 
20.3.1  Introduction of New 
Varieties of Plants
It is a process of introducing high yielding 
varieties of plants from one place to another. Such 
plants are called as exotic species. These imported 
plant materials may carry pathogens and pests, 
hence they are thoroughly tested in a plant 
quarantine before being introduced to the fields. 
e.g Phaseolus mungo was introduced from China.

20.3.2 Selection
Selection is one of the oldest methods of 
plant breeding in which individual plants or 
groups of plants are sorted out from a mixed 
population based on the morphological 
characters. 
Methods of selection
There are three methods of selection. 
They are 
1. Mass selection
2. Pureline selection 
3. Clonal selection
1. Mass selection
Seeds of best plants showing desired 
characters are collected from a mixed 
population. The collected seeds are allowed 
to raise the second generation. This process is 
carried out for seven or eight generations. At 
the end, they will be multiplied and distributed 
to the farmers for cultivation. 
Some 
common 
examples 
for 
mass 
selection are groundnut varieties like TMV–2 
and AK–10. Its schematic representation is 
given below.
Figure 20.5 Mass Selection
2. Pureline selection
Pureline is “the progeny of a single 
individual obtained by self breeding”. This 
is also called as individual plant selection. 
In pureline selection large numbers of plants 
are selected from a self-pollinated crop and 
harvested individually. 
Individual plant progenies from them are 
evaluated separately. The best one is released 
as a pureline variety. Progeny is similar both 
genotypically and phenotypically. 
3. Clonal selection
A group of plants produced from a 
single plant through vegetative or asexual 
reproduction are called clones. 
All the plants of a clone are similar both 
in genotype and phenotype. Selection of 
desirable clones from the mixed population of 
vegetatively propagated crop is called clonal 
selection. 
20.3.3 Polyploidy Breeding
Sexually reproducing organisms have 
two complete set of chromosomes in their 
somatic cells. This is called diploid (2n). 
The gametic cells have only one set of 
chromosome. This is called haploid (n). 
An organism having more than two sets of 
chromosomes is called polyploid (Greek : 
Polys = many + aploos = one fold + eidos = 
form). Such condition is called Polyploidy. It 
can be induced by physical agents such as 
heat or cold treatment, X-rays and chemical 
agents like colchicine.
Achievements of polyploidy breeding
Some 
achievements 
of 
polyploidy 
breeding are 
a. Seedless watermelons (3n) and bananas (3n).
b. TV-29 (triploid variety of tea) with larger 
shoots and drought tolerance.
c. Triticale (6n) is a hybrid of wheat and rye. To 
make this plant fertile polyploidy is induced. 
It has higher dietary fibre and protein. 
d. Raphano brassica is an allotetraploid by 
colchicine treatment.

20.3.4 Mutation Breeding
Mutation is defined as the sudden 
heritable change in the nucleotide sequence 
of DNA in an organism. It is a process by 
which genetic variations are created which 
in turn brings about changes in the organism. 
The organism which undergoes mutation is 
called a mutant. 
The factors which induce mutations are 
known as mutagens or mutagenic agents.
Mutagens are of two types namely physical 
mutagens and chemical mutagens.
More to Know
Gamma Garden
Gamma garden or Atomic garden is a 
concept popularised after World War  II for 
the peaceful use of atomic energy for crop 
improvement. This is a type of induced 
mutation breeding where radioactive sources 
particularly gamma rays from Cobalt-60 or 
Caesium-137 are used to induce desirable 
mutations in crop  plants.
i Physical mutagens
Radiations like X-rays, α, β and γ-rays, 
UV  rays, temperature etc. which induce 
mutations are called physical mutagens
ii Chemical mutagens
Chemical 
substances 
that 
induce 
mutations are called chemical mutagens. 
e.g. Mustard gas and nitrous acid. The utilisation 
of induced mutation in crop improvement is 
called mutation breeding. 
Achievements of mutation breeding
Some achievements of mutation breeding are 
a. Sharbati Sonora wheat produced from 
Sonora-64 by using gamma rays. 
b. Atomita 2 rice with saline tolerance and 
pest resistance
c. Groundnuts with thick shells 
20.3.5 Hybridization
Hybridization may be defined as the 
process of crossing two or more types of plants 
for bringing their desired characters together 
into one progeny called hybrid. Hybrid is 
superior in one or more characters to both 
parents. Hybridization is the common method 
of creating genetic variation to get improved 
varieties.
Hybridization Experiment: Triticale (The 
first man – made cereal)
Triticale is the first man- made cereal 
hybrid. It is obtained by crossing wheat 
(Triticum durum, 2n = 28) and rye (Secale 
cereal, 2n = 14). The F1 hybrid is sterile 
(2n = 21). Then the chromosome number is 
doubled using colchicine and it becomes a 
hexaploid Triticale (2n = 42).
The cycle of crop raising and selection 
continues till the plants with the desired 
characters 
are 
finally 
obtained. 
The 
development of new varieties is a long-drawn 
process. Two main aspects of hybridization 
are to combine the characters of two plants in 
one plant and to utilize hybrid vigour. 
 20.4  Animal Breeding
A breed is a group of animals of common 
origin within a species that has certain 
distinguishing characters that are not found in 
other members of the same species like general 
appearance and others striking features.
Breeding involves mating parents of 
different varieties each having some desired 
trait which are passed onto the offspring.

Breeding and Biotechnology
Objectives of Animal Breeding
Animal breeding aims at improving the 
genotypes of domesticated animals to increase 
their yield and improve the desirable qualities to 
produce milk, egg and meat.
When breeding takes place between 
animals of the same breed, it is called 
inbreeding. The cross between different breeds 
is called outbreeding.
20.4.1 Inbreeding
Inbreeding refers to the mating of closely 
related animals within the same breed for 
about 4-6 generations. Superior males and 
superior females of the same breed are identified 
and mated in pairs. It helps in the accumulation 
of superior genes and elimination of genes 
which are undesirable. 
Hissardale is a new breed of sheep 
developed in Punjab by crossing Bikaneri 
(Magra) ewes and Australian Marino rams.
Inbreeding depression: Continued inbreeding 
reduces fertility and productivity. Inbreeding 
exposes harmful recessive genes that are 
eliminated by selection. 
20.4.2 Outbreeding
It is the breeding of unrelated animals. 
The offsprings formed are called hybrids. The 
hybrids are stronger and vigorous than their 
parents. Cross between two different species with 
desirable features of economic value are mated. 
Let’s see what cross produce a mule.

Hybrid fowl - yield more eggs
Cross breed of cows:
Developed by mating the bulls of exotic 
breeds and cows of indigenous breeds.
Brown Swiss X Sahiwal
Karan Swiss - yield 2-3 times more milk 
than indigenous cows.
20.4.3 Heterosis
The superiority of the hybrid obtained by 
cross breeding is called as heterosis or hybrid 
vigour.
Effects of hybrid vigour in animal breeding
- 
Increased production of milk by 
cattle
- 
Increased production of egg by poultry
- 
High quality of meat is produced
- 
Increased growth rate in domesticated 
animals

 20.5  Genetic Engineering
Genetic engineering is 
the manipulation and transfer 
of genes from one organism 
to another organisms to 
create a new DNA called as 
recombinant DNA(rDNA). 
The term recombinant is used because DNA 
from two different sources can be joined 
together. Hence, genetic engineering is also 
called as recombinant DNA technology. 
Plasmid 
is 
the 
 
small 
circular 
double 
stranded 
DNA molecule found in the 
cytoplasm of bacterial cell and separated 
from chromosomal DNA. It can replicate 
independently.
More to Know
Restriction enzymes recognises a specific 
base pair sequence (palindromic sequence) 
in DNA called as restriction site and cleaves 
the phosphodiester bond within DNA.
20.5.1  Techniques of Genetic 
Engineering – Basic 
Requirements
Important discoveries that led to the 
stepping stone of rDNA technology were
a. Presence of plasmid in bacteria that can 
undergo replication independently along 
with chromosomal DNA. 
b.  Restriction enzymes cuts or break DNA 
at specific sites and are also called as 
molecular scissors. 
c. DNA ligases are the enzymes which help in 
ligating (joining) the broken DNA fragments.
20.5.2 Gene Cloning
What reminds to your mind when you 
hear the word clone? Of course, ‘DOLLY’ 
the cloned sheep. The carbon copy of an 
individual is often called a clone. However, 
more appropriately, a clone means to make a 
genetically exact copy of an organism. 
In gene cloning, a gene or a piece of 
DNA fragment is inserted into a bacterial cell 
where DNA will be multiplied (copied) as the 
cell divides. A brief outline of the basic steps 
involved in gene cloning are:  
i. Isolation of desired DNA fragment by 
using restriction enzymes
ii. Insertion of the DNA fragment into a 
suitable vector (Plasmid) to make rDNA
iii. Transfer of rDNA into bacterial host cell 
(Transformation)
iv. Selection and multiplication of recombinant 
host cell to get a clone
v. Expression of cloned gene in host cell. 
Using this strategy several enzymes, 
hormones and vaccines can be produced

 20.6  Biotechnology in Medicine
Using genetic engineering techniques 
medicinally 
important 
valuable 
proteins 
or polypeptides that form the potential 
pharmaceutical products for treatment of 
various diseases have been developed on a 
commercial scale. 
Pharmaceutical 
products

by 
rDNA technique
a. Insulin used in the treatment of diabetes. 
b. Human growth hormone used for treating 
children with growth deficiencies.
c. Blood clotting factors are developed to 
treat haemophilia. 
d. Tissue plasminogen activator is used to 
dissolve blood clots and prevent heart attack.
e. Development of vaccines against various 
diseases like Hepatitis B and rabies
Eli Lilly and Company, 
United States, in 1979 first 
started commercial production 
of 
human 
insulin 
by 
using 
rDNA 
technology.
Gene Therapy
Gene therapy refers to the replacement 
of defective gene by the direct transfer of 
functional genes into humans to treat genetic 
disease or disorder. The genetic makeup of 
the ‘patient’ cell is altered using recombinant 
DNA technology. It was first successfully 
implemented in 1990. 
Somatic gene therapy is the replacement 
of defective gene in somatic cells. 
Germ line gene therapy replacement of 
defective gene in germ cell (egg and sperm).
Gene therapy conducted till date has 
targeted only somatic (non-reproductive) 
cells. Correction of genetic defects in somatic 
cells may be beneficial to the patient but the 
corrected gene may not be carried to the next 
generation.
 20.7  Stem Cells
Our body is composed of over 200 
specialised cell types, that can carry out specific 
functions. e.g. neurons or nerve cell that can 
transmit signals, or heart cells which contract 
to pump blood or pancreatic cells to secrete 
insulin. These specialised cells are called as 
differentiated cells. 
In contrast to differentiated cells, stem 
cells are undifferentiated or unspecialised 
mass of cells. The stem cells are the cells of

Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease 
neuronal stem cells can be used to replace the 
damaged or lost neurons.
 20.8   DNA Fingerprinting 
Technology 
The human genome has 3 billion base 
pairs. Did you know that the DNA pattern 
of two individuals cannot be same except for 
identical twins. Each person’s DNA sequence 
is unique due to the small difference in the base 
pairs. Therefore, if we want to compare the 
genetic difference among the two individuals, 
DNA fingerprinting is the easier and quicker 
method. This technique was developed by 
Alec Jeffrey. 
The technique analyses each individual’s 
unique 
DNA 
sequences 
and 
provides 
distinctive characteristics of individual which 
helps in identification. Variable number of 
tandem repeat sequences (VNTRs) serve as 
molecular markers for identification.
In human beings, 99 % of the DNA base 
sequences are the same and this is called 
as bulk genomic DNA. The remaining 1 % 
DNA sequence differs from one individual to 
another. This 1 % DNA sequence is present 
as small stretch of repeated sequences which 
is known as satellite DNA. The number of 
copies of the repeat sequence also called 
as VNTRs differs from one individual to 
another, and results in variation in the size of 
the DNA segment.
VNTRs illustration of three persons
As shown in the illustration, the sequence 
AGCT is repeated six times in first person, five 
times in second person and seven times in third 
variable potency. Potency refers to the number 
of possible fates that a cell can acquire. The 
two important properties of stem cells that 
differentiate them from other cells are:
i. its ability to divide and give rise to more 
stem cells by self-renewal
ii. its ability to give rise to specialised cells 
with specific functions by the process of 
differentiation.
Types of stem cells 
Embryonic stem cells can be extracted 
and cultured from the early embryos. These 
cells are derived from the inner cell mass of 
blastocyst. These cells can be developed into 
any cell in the body.
Adult stem cell or somatic stem cell are 
found in the neonatal (new born) and adults. 
They have the ability to divide and give rise to 
specific cell types. Sources of adult stem cells 
are amniotic fluid, umbilical cord and bone 
marrow. 
Figure 20.8 Differentiation of stem cells
Stem-cell therapy
Sometimes cells, tissues and organs in the 
body may be permanently damaged or lost due 
to genetic condition or disease or injury. In such 
situations stem cells are used for the treatment 
of diseases which is called stem-cell therapy. 
In treating neurodegenerative disorders like

person. Because of this, DNA segment of third 
person will be larger in size followed by DNA 
segment of first person and then the second 
person. Thus, it is clear that satellite DNA 
bring about variation within the population. 
Variation in DNA banding pattern reveals 
differences among the individuals.
Applications of DNA Fingerprinting
i. DNA fingerprinting technique is widely 
used in forensic applications like crime 
investigation such as identifying the 
culprit. It is also used for paternity testing 
in case of disputes. 
ii. It also helps in the study of genetic diversity 
of population, evolution and speciation.
 20.9   Genetically Modified 
Organisms (GMOs)
One of the most tremendous development 
of genetic engineering is the production of 
genetically modified (GM) plants and animals. 
Genetic modification refers to the alteration 
or manipulation of genes in the organisms 
using rDNA techniques in order to produce 
the desired characteristics. The DNA fragment 
inserted is called transgene. Plants or animals 
expressing a modified endogenous gene or 
a foregin gene are also known as transgenic 
organisms.
The transgenic plants are much stable, 
with improved nutritional quality, resistant to 
diseases and tolerant to various environment 
conditions. 
Similarly 
transgenic 
animals 
are used to produce proteins of medicinal 
importance at low cost and improve livestock 
quality.
Some examples of genetically modified 
plants and animals are given in the table
