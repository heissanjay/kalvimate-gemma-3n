         INTRODUCTION
You have learnt, in your lower classes 
that matter is around us everywhere. Matter is 
made of atoms. Curiously the idea of atom was 
first proposed by the Greek philosophers in the 
fifth century BC (BCE). But, their theory was 
more philosophical than scientific. 
The first scientific theory of the atom 
was proposed by John Dalton. Few of the 
postulates of Dalton’s theory about an 
atom were found incorrect by the later on 
studies made by J.J. Thomson, Rutherford, 
Neils Bohr and Schrodinger. In the light 
of the result of the researches most of the 
limitations of the Dalton’s theory were 
removed and a new theory known as the 
modern atomic theory was put forward. 
‘The main postulates of modern atomic 
theory’ are as follows: 
An atom is no longer indivisible (after 
the discovery of the electron, proton, and 
neutron).
 Atoms of the same element may have 
different atomic mass. (discovery of 
isotopes 17Cl
35, 17Cl
37).
 Atoms of different elements may have same 
atomic masses (discovery of Isobars 18Ar
40, 
20Ca
40).
 Atoms of one element can be transmuted 
into atoms of other elements. In other 
words, atom is no longer indestructible 
(discovery of artificial transmutation).

 Atoms may not always combine in a simple 
whole number ratio (E.g. Glucose C6H12O6 
C:H:O = 6:12:6 or 1:2:1 and Sucrose 
C12H22O11 C:H:O = 12:22:11).
 Atom is the smallest particle that takes 
part in a chemical reaction.
 The mass of an atom can be converted into 
energy (E = mc
2).
The modern atomic theory is the basis 
for all the studies of chemical and physical 
processes that involve atoms. You have studied 
the most fundamental ideas about an atom in 
your lower classes. Let us discuss some more 
concepts about atoms in this lesson.
 7.1  ATOM AND ATOMIC MASS
As you know, anything that has mass and 
occupies space is called matter. Atoms are the 
building blocks of matter. Since matter has 
mass, it must be due to its atoms. According to 
the modern atomic theory, an atom contains 
subatomic particles such as protons, neutrons 
and electrons. Protons and neutrons have 
considerable mass, but electrons don't have 
such a considerable mass. Thus, the mass of an 
atom is mainly contributed by its protons and 
neutrons and hence the sum of the number of 
protons and neutrons of an atom is called its 
mass number. 
Individual atoms are very small and it 
is difficult to measure their masses. You can 
measure the mass of macroscopic materials 
in gram or kilogram. The mass of an atom is 
measured in atomic mass unit (amu). 
Atomic mass unit is one-twelfth of the 
mass of a carbon-12 atom; an isotope of carbon, 
which contains 6 protons and 6 neutrons. 
(Note: The symbol ‘amu’ is no longer 
used in the modern system and instead, it 
uses the symbol ‘U’ to denote unified atomic 
mass. The mass of a proton or neutron is 
approximately 1 amu).
7.1.1  Relative Atomic Mass  
(RAM)
As an atom is very small, its absolute 
mass cannot be determined directly. The early 
pioneers of chemistry used to measure the 
atomic mass of an atom relative to an atom of 
another element. They measured the masses 
of equal number of atoms of two or more 
elements at a time, to determine their relative 
masses. They established one element as a 
standard, gave it an arbitrary value of atomic 
mass and using this value they measured 
the relative mass of other elements. The 
mass obtained by this way is called relative 
atomic mass. In the beginning, the mass of 
hydrogen atom was chosen as a standard and 
masses of other atoms were compared with it, 
because of the existence of isotopic character 
of hydrogen (1H
1, 1H
2, 1H
3). Later hydrogen 
atom was replaced by oxygen atom as the 
standard. Now, the stable isotope of carbon 
(C-12) with atomic mass 12 is used as the 
standard for measuring the relative atomic 
mass of an element.
Relative atomic mass of an element 
is the ratio between the average mass of 
its isotopes to 
1
12th  part of the mass of a 
carbon-12 atom. It is denoted as Ar. It is 
otherwise called “Standard Atomic Weight”.
Relative Atomic Mass
(Ar) = Average mass of the isotopes of the element
of the mass of  one Carbon-12 atom
1
12th
Modern methods of determination of 
atomic mass by Mass Spectrometry uses 
C-12 as standard. For most of the elements, 
the relative atomic mass is very closer to a 
whole number and it is rounded off to a whole 
number, to make calculations easier. Table 7.1 
lists some of the elements of periodic table and 
their Ar values.

Table 7.1 Relative atomic mass  
of elements (C-12 Scale)
Relative Atomic Mass is only a 
ratio, so it has no unit. If the 
atomic mass of an element is 
expressed in grams, it is called 
as Gram Atomic Mass
Gram Atomic Mass of hydrogen = 1 g
Gram Atomic Mass of carbon 
= 12 g
Gram Atomic Mass of nitrogen 
= 14 g
Gram Atomic Mass of oxygen 
= 16 g 
7.1.2  Average Atomic Mass (AAM)
How can one measure 
the atomic mass of an 
element? It is somewhat more 
complicated because most 
of the naturally occuring 
elements exist as a mixture 
of isotopes, each of which has its own mass. 
Thus, it is essential to consider this isotopic 
mixture while calculating the atomic mass of 
an element. 
The average atomic mass of an element 
is the weighted average of the masses of its 
naturally occurring isotopes. 
But, the abundance of isotopes of each 
element may differ. So, the abundancy of all 
these isotopes are taken into consideration 
while calculating the atomic mass. Then, what 
do we mean by a weighted average? Let us 
consider an element which exists as a mixture 
of 50% of an isotope having a mass of 9 amu, 
and 50% of another isotope having a mass 
of 10 amu. Then, its average atomic mass is 
calculated by the following equation:
Average atomic mass
=  (Mass of 1st isotope × % abundance of 
1st isotope) + (Mass of 2nd isotope × 
% abundance of 2nd isotope)
Thus, for the given element the average 
atomic mass = (9 ×           )
50
100
(10 ×           )
50
100
+
 
= 4.5 + 5 = 9.5 amu
(Note: In the calculations involving 
percentages, you need to convert percentage 
abundance 
into 
fractional 
abundance. 
For example, 50 percent is converted into 
50/100 or 0.50 as shown in the a foresaid 
calculation.)
The atomic masses of elements, given in 
the periodic table, are average atomic masses. 
Sometimes, the term atomic weight is used 
to mean average atomic mass. It is observed, 
from the periodic table that atomic masses of 
most of the elements are not whole numbers. 
For instance, the atomic mass of carbon given 
in the periodic table is 12.01 amu, not 12.00 
amu. The reason is that while calculating the 
atomic mass of carbon, both of its natural 
isotopes such as carbon-12. and carbon-13 are 
considered. The natural abundance of C-12 
and C-13 are 98.90 % and 1.10 % respectively. 
The average of the atomic mass of carbon is 
calculated as follows:
Average atomic mass of carbon
= (12 ×          )
98.9
100
 + (13 ×          )
1.1
100
= (12 × 0.989) + (13 × 0.011)
= 11.868 + 0.143 = 12.011 amu
So it is important to understand that if it 
is mentioned that the atomic mass of carbon 
is 12 amu, it refers to the average atomic mass 
of the carbon isotopes, not the mass of the 
individual atoms of carbon.

= 15.999 amu.
Example 2:  Boron naturally occurs as a mixture 
of boron-10 (5 protons + 5 neutrons) and 
boron-11 (5 protons + 6 neutrons) isotopes. 
The percentage abundance of B-10 is 20 and 
that of B-11 is 80. Then, the atomic mass of 
boron is calculated as follows:

 7.2   MOLECULE AND 
MOLECULAR MASS
Except noble gases, atoms of most of the 
elements are found in the combined form with 
itself or atoms of other elements. It is called as 
a molecule. A molecule is a combination of 
two or more atoms held together by strong 
chemical forces of attraction, i.e. chemical 
bonds.

Thoughts
All compounds
are molecules;
but,all molecules
are not compounds
why?
7.2.1 Classification of molecules
A molecule may contain atoms of the same 
element or may contain atoms of two or more 
elements joined in a fixed ratio, in accordance 
with the law of definite proportions. Thus, a 
 molecule may be an element or a compound. If 
the  molecule is made of similar kind of  atoms, 
then it is called homoatomic molecule. 
The molecule that consist of atoms of 
different  elements is called heteroatomic 
molecule. A compound is a heteroatomic 
molecule. The number of atoms present in the 
molecule is called its ‘atomicity’.

Let us consider oxygen. Oxygen gas 
exists in two allotropic forms: Oxygen (O2) 
and Ozone (O3). In oxygen molecule, there 
are two oxygen atoms. So its atomicity is two. 
Since both the atoms are similar, oxygen (O2) 
is a homodiatomic molecule. Other elements

then it is called polyatomic molecule.
Conisder hydrogen chloride. It consists 
of two atoms, but of different elements, i.e. 
hydrogen and chlorine. So, its atomicity is two. 
It is a heterodiatomic molecule. Similarly, the 
water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms 
and one oxygen atom. So its atomicity is three. It 
is a heterotriatomic molecule.

As the molecules are made of atoms, 
they also have their own mass. The mass of 
the molecule of an element or compound is 
measured in the C-12 scale and hence called 
relative molecular mass.
The Relative Molecular Mass of a

Relative Molecular Mass is 
only a ratio. So, it has no unit. 
If the molecular mass of a com-
pound is expressed in grams, 
it is called Gram Molecular 
Mass.
Gram Molecular Mass of water 
= 18 g
Gram Molecular Mass of  
carbon dioxide  
= 44 g
Gram Molecular Mass of  
ammonia 
= 17 g
Gram  Molecular Mass of HCl 
= 36.5 g
The relative molecular mass is obtained by 
adding together the relative atomic masses of all 
the atoms present in a molecule.
Calculation of relative molecular mass – 
Solved examples:
Example 1: Relative molecular mass of 
sulphuric acid (H2SO4) is calculated as follows: 
Sulphuric acid conatins 2 atoms of hydrogen, 
1 atom of sulphur and 4 atoms of oxygen.
Therefore, Relative molecular mass of 
sulphuric acid =  (2 × mass of hydrogen) +  
(1 × mass of sulphur) +  
(4 × mass of oxygen)
 
= (2 × 1) + (1 × 32) + (4 × 16)
 
= 98 
i.e., one molecule of H2SO4 is 98 times as 
heavy as 1
12th
 of the mass of a carbon –12.
Example 2: Relative molecular mass of 
 water (H2O) is calculated as follows: A water 
molecule is made of 2 atoms of hydrogen and 
one atom of oxygen.
So, the relative molecular mass of  water 
 
=  (2 × mass of hydrogen) + (1 × mass of 
oxygen)
 
= (2 × 1) + (1 × 16)
 
= 18  
i.e., one molecule of H2O is 18 times as 
heavy as 1
12th  of the mass of a carbon –12.
 7.3   DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
ATOMS AND MOLECULES
Even 
though 
atoms 
are 
the 
basic 
 components of molecules, they differ in many 
aspects when compared to the molecules. Table 
7.5 consolidates the major difference between 
 atoms and molecules.

 7.4  MOLE CONCEPT
So far we discussed about matters in terms 
of individual atoms and molecules. Atomic 
mass units provide a relative scale for the  masses 
of the elements. Since the atoms have such 
small masses, no usable scale can be devised 
to weigh them in the calibrated units of atomic 
mass units. In any real situation, we deal with 
 macroscopic samples containing enormous 
number of  atoms. Therefore, it is convenient 
to have a special unit to describe a very large 
number of atoms. The idea of a ‘unit’ to denote 
a 
 particular number of objects is not new. For 
example, the pair (2 items) and the dozen 
(12 items), are all familiar units. Chemists 
measure atoms and molecules in ‘moles’. So, 
you can now understand that ‘mole’ denotes a 
number of particles.

Atoms and molecules
In the SI system, the mole (mol) is the 
amount of a substance that contains as many 
elementary entities (atoms, molecules, or other 
particles) as there are atoms in exactly 12 g 
(or 0.012 kg) of the carbon-12 isotope. The 
actual number of atoms in 12 g of carbon-12 
is determined experimentally. This is called 
Avogadro’s Number (NA), named after an Italian 
scientist Amedeo Avogadro who proposed 
its significance. Its value is 6.023 × 10
23. So 
one mole of a substance contains 6.023 × 10
23 
entities. Thus, 5 moles of oxygen molecules 
contain 5 × 6.023 ×10
23
 molecules.
Mole Concept: The study of the collection 
of particles by using mole as the counting unit, 
in order to express the mass and volume of such 
unit particles in a bulk of matter is known as 
mole concept.
The number of moles of a substance can be 
calculated by various means depending on the 
data available, as follows:
 Number of moles of molecules.
 Number of moles of atoms.
 Number of moles of a gas (Standard molar 
volume at STP = 22.4 litre).
 Number of moles of ions.
Note:
STP-Standard 
Temperature 
and 
Pressure(273.15 K,1 atm)
Mole of atoms:
One mole of an element contains 
6.023 × 10
23 atoms and it is equal to its gram 
atomic mass.
i.e., one mole of oxygen atom contains 
6.023 × 10
23 atoms of oxygen and its gram atomic 
mass  is 16 g.
Mole of molecules:
One mole of matter contains 6.023 × 10
23 
molecules and it is equal to its gram molecular 
mass.
i.e., one mole of oxygen molecule contains 
6.023 × 10
23 molecules of oxygen and its gram 
molecular mass is 32 g.
Molar volume:
One mole of any gas occupies 22.4 litre or 
22400 ml at S.T.P. This volume is called as molar 
volume.

 7.5  PERCENT COMPOSITION
So for, we were dealing with the number of 
entities present in a given substance. But many 
times, the information regarding the percentage 
of a particular element present in a compound is 
required.
The percentage composition of a  compound 
represents the mass of each element present in 
100 g of the compound.
Let 
us 
understand 
the 
percentage 
 composition of oxygen and hydrogen by taking

the example of H2O. It can be calculated using 
the formula
Mass % of an element
= mass of that element in the compound × 100
molecular mass of the compound
Now,
 
molecular mass of H2O = 2(1) + 16
 
= 18 g
Mass % of hydrogen =

= 11.11 %
Mass % of oxygen = 16 × 100

= 88.89 %
This percentage composition is useful to 
determine the empirical formula and molecular 
formula.
Example 1: Find the mass percentage 
 composition of methane (CH4).
      molecular mass of CH4  = 12 + 4
 
        = 16 g
Mass % of carbon = 12 × 100

= 75 %
Mass % of hydrogen =

= 25 %
 7.6  AVOGADRO HYPOTHESIS
In 1811 Avogadro framed a hypothesis 
based on the relationship between the  number 
of molecules present in equal volumes of gases 
in different  conditions.
The Avogadro’s law states that “equal 
 volumes of all gases under similar conditions 
of temperature and pressure contain equal 
number of molecules”
It follows that the volume of any given 
gas must be proportional to the number of 
molecules in it. If ‘V’ is the volume and ‘n’ is the 
number of molecules of a gas, then Avogadro 
law is represented, mathematically, as follows:
V α n
V = constant × n
Thus, one litre (1 dm
3) of hydrogen contains 
the same number of molecules as in one litre 
of oxygen, i.e. the volume of the gas is directly 
proportional to the number of molecules of the 
gas.
Figure 7.4 Avogadro Hypothesis
Explanation
Let us consider the reaction between 
 hydrogen and chlorine to form hydrogen 
 chloride gas
H2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2 HCl(g)
1 vol + 1 vol → 2 volumes
According to Avogadro’s law 1 volume of 
any gas is occupied by “n” number of molecules.
n molecules + n molecules → 2n molecules
 
if n = 1 then 
1molecule + 1 molecule → 2 molecules.
½ molecule + ½ molecule → 1 molecule
1 molecule of hydrogen chloride gas is 
made up of ½ molecule of hydrogen and ½ 
molecule of chlorine. Hence, the molecules can 
be subdivided. This law is in agreement with 
Dalton’s atomic theory.

 7.7   APPLICATIONS OF 
AVOGADRO’S LAW
i. It explains Gay-Lussac’s law.
ii. It helps in the determination of atomicity of 
gases.
iii. Molecular formula of gases can be derived 
using Avogadro’s law
iv. It determines the relation between molecular 
mass and vapour density.
v. It helps to determine gram molar volume of 
all gases (i.e, 22.4 litre at S.T.P)
 7.8   RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 
VAPOUR DENSITY AND 
RELATIVE MOLECULAR 
MASS
i. Relative molecular mass:
(Hydrogen scale)
The Relative Molecular Mass of a gas or 
vapour is the ratio between the mass of one 
molecule of the gas or vapour to 
 mass of one 
atom of Hydrogen. 
ii. Vapour Density:
Vapour density is the ratio of the mass 
of a certain volume of a gas or vapour, to the 
mass of an equal volume of hydrogen, measured 
under the same conditions of temperature and 
pressure.
Vapour Density (V.D.) 
=
Mass of a given volume of gas or vapour at S.T.P.
Mass of the same volume of hydrogen
According to Avogadro's law, equal 
 volumes of all gases contain equal number of 
molecules.
Thus, let the number of molecules in one 
volume = n, then
V.D. at S.T.P  
=
Mass of ‘n’ molecules of a gas or vapour at 
S.T.P.
Mass of ‘n’ molecules of hydrogen
Cancelling 'n' which is common, you get
V.D. 
= Mass of 1 molecule of a gas or vapour at S.T.P.
Mass of 1 molecules of hydrogen
However, since hydrogen is diatomic 
V.D. 
= Mass of 1 molecule of a gas or vapour at S.T.P.
Mass of 2 atoms of hydrogen
When you compare the formula of vapour 
density with relative molecular mass, they can 
be represented as
V.D. 
= Mass of 1 molecule of a gas or vapour at S.T.P.
2 × Mass of 1 atom of hydrogen
 
(Eqn 7.1)
Relative molecular mass (hydrogen scale) = 
Mass of 1 molecule of a gas or vapour at STP
Mass of 1 atom of hydrogen
 
(Eqn 7.2)
You can therefore substitute the above 
equation to an Eqn 7.1 and arrive at the 
following formula
V.D. =
Relative molecular mass
2
Now on cross multiplication, you have
2 × vapour density = Relative molecular mass 
of a gas
(Or)

Points to Remember
 Two or more forms of an element having 
the same atomic number, but different mass 
number are called Isotopes (17Cl
35, 17Cl
37).
 Atoms of different elements having the 
same mass number, but different atomic 
numbers are called Isobars (18Ar
40, 20Ca
40).
 Atoms of different elements having the 
same number of neutrons, but different 
atomic number and different mass number 
are called Isotones ( 6C
13, 7N
14 ).
 Relative atomic mass of an element is the 
ratio between the mass of one atom of the 
element to 1/12th of the mass of the atom of 
carbon -12.
 Average atomic mass of an element is 
calculated by adding the masses of its 
isotopes, each multiplied by their natural 
abundance on the Earth.
 Relative molecular mass of a molecule is the 
ratio between the mass of one molecule of 
the substance to 1/12th of the mass of the 
atom of carbon – 12.
 The Avogadro’s law states that “equal 
volumes of all gases under similar 
conditions of temperature and pressure 
contain equal number of molecules”.
 The vapour density is defined as “the ratio 
between the masses of equal volumes of a 
gas (or a vapour) and hydrogen under the 
same condition”.
 Atomicity of a monoatomic element = 
Molecular mass / Atomic Mass.
 Molecular mass = 2 × Vapour density.
