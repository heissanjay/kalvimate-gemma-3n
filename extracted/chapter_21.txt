       Introduction 
Abuses occur in a variety of forms and are 
deeply rooted in cultural, social and economic 
practices. Solving this global problem however 
requires a much better understanding of its 
occurrence, causes and consequences with 
context to sexual and childhood abuse, this 
is followed by substance abuse. Are people 
leading healthier lives in today’s modern 
world than their generations did in the past? 
For instance, smoking cigarettes, alcohol 
addiction, use of drugs, eating high fat and 
cholesterol rich diets, excessive intake of junk 
foods, reduced physical activity are some of 
the risk factors for illness and early death. The 
role of behaviour in health has been receiving 
increased attention in countries around the 
world. The health habits of the individuals and 
their behaviour influence the development of 
chronic and fatal diseases such as diabetes, 
obesity, heart disease, cancer and AIDS. These 
conditions can be substantially reduced by 
adopting lifestyles that promote wellness and 
protect their health by taking nutritious diet, 
regular exercise and by avoiding drugs, alcohol 
and smoking. 
 21.1  Abuse and Types of Abuse
Abuse refers to cruel, violent, harmful or 
injurious treatment of another human being. It 
includes physical, emotional or psychological, 
verbal, child and sexual abuses. Abuse can 
occur within the family and with people who 
are not associated with the family.

Health and Diseases
These days the use of drugs, alcohol and 
tobacco has been increasing especially among 
teenagers and adolescents for adventure, 
excitement, curiosity and experimentation. 
Let's analyse some of the consequences of 
sexual and childhood abuse, its prevention and 
protection.
21.1.1 Child Abuse
Child abuse constitutes all forms of 
physical or emotional ill treatment, sexual 
abuse, exploitation resulting in child’s ill 
health, survival and development. Physical 
abuse of a child is defined as those acts that 
cause physical harm such as threatening, 
beating, kicking and hitting the child.
21.1.2 Sexual Abuse 
Sexual harassment is a form of power 
and dominance of one person over another, 
which can result in harmful consequence to 
the victim. It refers to inappropriate or forced 
sexual contact. Adolescent girls and women 
encounter sexual harassment in different 
forms. Sexual abuse is more common at work 
places. Verbal remarks, comments, gestures 
and looks are the most common forms of 
abuse. This results in psychological distress, 
physical illness and eating disorders in the 
affected individuals.
21.1.3 Child Sexual Abuse 
Children are considered soft targets for 
sexual abuse because they may not realize 
that they are being abused. Commonly, 
abusers are persons well known to the child, 
may even be living in the same locality. 
Abusers also bribe (use chocolates and toys) 
to lure children and take advantage of the 
child’s innocence.
Sexually abused children show symptoms 
of genital injury, abdominal pain, frequent 
urinary infection and behavioural problems. 
21.1.4  Approaches for Protection 
of an Abused Child
Measures 
adopted 
for 
monitoring 
and assessment of abused child who have 
undergone signs and symptoms of distress are: 
Child Helpline: The Child Helpline 
provides a social worker who can assist the 
child by providing food, shelter and protection.
Counselling the child: Psychologists and social 
workers should provide guidance, counselling 
and continous support to a victimized child. 
Family support: The victimized child should 
be supported by the family members. They 
should be provided with proper care and 
attention to overcome their sufferings. 
Medical care: A child victim of sexual offences 
should receive medical care and treatment 
from health care professionals to overcome 
mental stress and depression. 
More to Know
The Ministry of Women and Child 
Development championed the introduction 
of the Protection of Children from Sexual 
Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012. People who 
traffic children for sexual purposes are also 
punishable under the provisions relating to 
the Act.
Objectives of the POCSO Act, 2012
 
 To protect children from the offences of 
 
• Sexual assault
 
• Sexual harassment
 
• Pornography
 
 To establish Special Courts for speedy 
trial of such offences.

Legal Counsel: The family or the guardian 
of the child victim shall be entitled to free 
assistance of a legal counsel for such offence. 
Rehabilitation: Enrolling in schools and 
resuming their education is an important step 
towards rehabilitation of the child. It is essential 
that the child’s life is gradually returned to 
normal after the incidence of abuse. 
Community based efforts: Conducting 
awareness campaign on child abuse and its 
prevention. 
More to Know
The 
National 
Commission 
for 
Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) was set 
up in March 2007 under the Commissions 
for Protection of Child Rights (CPCR) Act, 
2005. This act emphasizes the principle of 
universality and inviolability of child rights 
and recognizes the tone of urgency in all the 
child related policies of the country. 
Protection of all children of all age group 
upto 18 years of age is of equal importance. 
Policies define priority actions for the most 
vulnerable children.
   
   
CHILD HELPLINE 1098  
Prevention of child sexual abuse
The 
most 
important 
social 
policy 
proclaimed universally is the prevention of child 
abuse. Taking steps to prevent childhood sexual 
abuse is parental and institutional responsibility. 
Instructions to be given by parents and teachers 
to the child are. 
 
 Do not talk to any suspected person or 
strangers and to maintain a distance. 
 
 Not to be alone with unknown person.
 
 To be careful while travelling alone in 
public or private transport.
 
 Not to receive money, toys, gifts or 
chocolates from known or unknown 
person to them without the knowledge of 
their parents.
 
 Not to allow known or unknown person to 
touch them. 
It is the responsibility of every individual 
living in a society to ensure a safe and protected 
environment for our children to enable them 
to live with dignity and free from any form of 
violence.
 21.2   Drug, Alcohol and 
Tobacco Abuse
The physical and 
mental 
dependency 
on alcohol, smoking 
and drugs is called 
addiction. 
The 
addictive 
potential 
of 
these 
substances 
pulls 
an 
individual 
into a vicious cycle leading to regular abuse 
and dependency. This is of serious concern 
because abuse of tobacco, alcohol or drugs 
produce many harmful effects in an individual, 
to the family and even to the society. This 
dangerous behavior pattern among youth can 
be prevented through proper guidance.
 21.3  Drug Abuse 
Drugs 
are 
normally 
used 
for 
the 
treatment of disease on advice of a physician 
and withdrawn after recovery. A person who 
is habituated to a drug due to its prolonged 
use is called drug addict. This is called drug 
addiction or drug abuse. 
A drug that modifies the physical, 
biological, psychological or social behaviour of a 
person by stimulating, depressing or disturbing 
the functions of the body and the mind is called 
addictive drug. These drugs interact with the

central nervous system and affect the individual 
physically and mentally.  
21.3.1 Types of Drugs
There 
are 
certain 
drugs 
called 
psychotropic drugs which acts on the brain 
and alter the behaviour, consciousness, power 
of thinking and perception. They are referred 
as mood altering drugs. 
21.3.2  Drug Dependence
Persons who consume these drugs 
become fully dependent on them, they cannot 
live without drugs. This condition is referred 
as drug dependence. 
 •
Physical 
and 
mental 
dependence 
Dependence on the drug for normal 
condition of well being and to maintain 
physiological state.
 •
Psychological dependence is a feel that 
drugs help them to reduce stress.

International 
Day 
against Drug Abuse and Illicit 
Trafficking - June 26.
 
 Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic 
Substances Act was introduced in 1985.
21.3.3  Behavioural Changes of 
Drug Users 
Adverse effects of drug use among 
adolescents are 
 •
Drop in academic performance, absence 
from school or college. 
 •
Lack of interest in personal hygiene, 
isolation, depression, fatigue and aggressive 
behaviour. 
 •
Deteriorating relationship with family and 
friends. 
 •
Change in food and sleeping habits. 
 •
Fluctuation in body weight and appetite 
 •
Always looking out for an easy way to get 
money for obtaining drugs. 
 •
Prone to infections like AIDS and 
Hepatitis-B. 
World Health Organization 
(WHO) 1984 suggested the use 
of the term drug dependence 
in place of drug addiction or drug abuse
21.3.4 Drug De-addiction 
Management 
of 
de-addiction 
is 
a 
complicated and difficult task. The path to 
recovery of drug addicts is long and often slow.
Family 
members, 
friends and society on 
the whole have a very 
important role to play.
Detoxification: The first 
phase of treatment is detoxification. The 
drug is stopped gradually and the addict 
is helped to overcome the withdrawal 
symptoms. The addict undergoes severe 
physical and emotional disturbance. This is 
taken care by specific medication. 
Psychotherapy: 
Individual 
and 
group 
counselling is given by psychologists and 
counsellors. The treatment includes efforts to 
reduce the addict’s stress, taught new ways to 
solve everyday’s problems, adequate diet, rest 
and relaxation. 
Counselling to family members: Social 
workers counsell family members in order to 
change the attitude of rejection so that the 
addict is accepted by the family and the society.
Rehabilitation: They are given proper 
vocational training so that they can lead a 
healthy life and become useful members of 
the society.

 21.4  Tobacco Abuse 
Tobacco is obtained from the tobacco plant 
Nicotiana tobaccum and Nicotiana rustica. The 
dried and cured leaves of its young branches 
make the commercial tobacco used worldwide. 
Addiction to tobacco is due to ‘nicotine’ an 
alkaloid present in it. Nicotine is a stimulant, 
highly harmful and poisonous substance.  
21.4.1 Tobacco Use
Tobacco is used for smoking, chewing 
and snuffing. Inhaling tobacco smoke from 
cigars, cigarettes, bidis, pipes, hukka is called 
smoking. Tobacco in powder form is chewed 
with pan. When powdered tobacco is taken 
through nose, it is called snuffing. 
21.4.2  Smoking Hazards and 
Effects of Tobacco
When smoke is inhaled, the chemicals get 
absorbed by the tissues and cause the following 
harmful effects 
(i) 
Benzopyrene and polycyclic hydrocarbons 
present in tobacco smoke is carcinogenic 
causing lung cancer.
(ii) Causes inflammation of throat and bronchi 
leading to conditions like bronchitis and 
pulmonary tuberculosis. 
(iii) Inflammation of lung alveoli, decrease 
surface area for gas exchange and cause 
emphysema. 
(iv) Carbon monoxide of tobacco smoke 
binds to haemoglobin of RBC and 
decreases its oxygen carrying capacity 
causing hypoxia in body tissues. 
(v) Increased blood pressure caused by 
smoking leads to increased risk of heart 
disease.
(vi) Causes increased gastric secretion which 
leads to gastric and duodenal ulcers. 
(vii) Tobacco chewing causes oral cancer 
(mouth cancer).
Info bits
World 
Health 
organization 
(WHO) 
1984 suggested the use of the term drug. 
WHO issued a directive under which all 
cigarette advertisements and packs carry a 
statutory warning “Smoking is injurious 
to Health”.
 Activity 1
Collect pictures of people affected by 
tobacco chewing and tobacco smoking.
Identify which part of the body is affected 
and the health hazards it can lead to. 
21.4.3  Prevention of Smoking
Knowing the dangers of smoking and 
chewing tobacco adolescents and the old 
people need to avoid these habits. Proper 
counselling and medical assistance can help an 
addict to give up the habit of smoking. 
More to Know
Anti Tobacco Act was passed on May 1st 
2004. By 2030 tobacco is expected to be 
single biggest cause of death worldwide 
accounting for 10  million deaths per 
year.
May 31st is observed as No Tobacco Day 
(World Anti-Tobacco Day)

 21.5  Alcohol Abuse
The consumption of alcohol is a social evil 
practiced by the wealthier and poorer sections 
of the society. The dependence of alcohol is 
called alcoholism and the addict is termed as 
alcoholic. It is called alcohol abuse. Drinking 
of alcohol impairs one’s physical, physiological 
and psychological functions. 
 Activity 2
Collect pictures of individuals with 
normal liver and alcoholic liver, compare 
and indicate the changes you find in them.
21.5.1  Harmful Effects of Alcohol 
to Health
Prolonged use of alcohol depresses the 
nervous system, by acting as a sedative and 
analgesic substance. Some of the harmful 
effects are
 •
Nerve cell damage resulting in various 
mental and physical disturbances 
 •
Lack of co-ordination of body organs 
 •
Blurred or reduced vision, results in road 
accidents 
 •
Dilation of blood vessels which may affect 
functioning of the heart 
 •
Liver damage resulting in fatty liver which 
leads to cirrhosis and formation of fibrous 
tissues 
 •
Body loses its control and consciousness 
eventually leading to health complications 
and ultimately to death

by increased blood glucose level due to 
insufficient, deficient or failure of insulin 
secretion. This is the most common pancreatic 
endocrine disorder. The incidence of Type-1 
and Type-2 diabetes is increasing worldwide. 
21.8.1  Type-1 Insulin Dependent 
Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) 
IDDM accounts for 10 to 20% of the 
known diabetics. The condition also occurs 
in children (juvenile onset diabetes) and 
young adults, the onset is usually sudden and 
can be life threatening. This is caused by the 
destruction of β-cells of the pancreas. It is 
characterized by abnormally elevated blood 
glucose levels (hyperglycemia) resulting from 
inadequate insulin secretion. 
Causes: Genetic inheritance and environmental 
factors (infections due to virus, acute stress) 
are the cause for this condition. 
21.8.2  Type-2 Non-Insulin 
Dependent Diabetes 
Mellitus (NIDDM)
This is also called as adult onset diabetes 
and accounting for 80 to 90% of the diabetic 
population. It develops slowly, usually milder 
and more stable. Insulin production by the 
pancreas is normal but its action is impaired. 
The target cells do not respond to insulin. It does 
not allow the movement of glucose into cells.
Causes: The causes are multifactorial 
which include increasing age (affecting middle 
aged and older people), obesity, sedentary life 
style, overeating and physically inactive.
More to Know
One in every 8 individuals in India is a 
diabetic. The revised WHO estimates for the 
year 2025 is 57.2 million diabetics in India. 
The average age for the onset of diabetes is 40 
years, while it is 55 years in other countries. 
World Health Organizaation projects that 
diabetes will be 7th leading cause of death by 
the year 2030.
Symptoms: Diabetes mellitus is associated 
with several metabolic alterations.The most 
important symptoms are 
 •
Increased 
blood 
glucose 
level 
(Hyperglycemia)
 •
Increased urine output (Polyuria) leading 
to dehydration
 •
Loss of water leads to thirst (Polydipsia) 
resulting in increased fluid intake
 •
Excessive glucose excreted in urine 
(Glycosuria)
 •
Excess hunger (Polyphagia) due to loss of 
glucose in urine. 
 •
Fatigue and loss of weight 
According 
to 
WHO 
recommendation, if the fasting 
blood glucose is greater than 
140 mg/dl or the random blood glucose 
is greater than 200 mg /dl on more than 
two occasions, diagnosis for confirming 
diabetes is essential.
21.8.3  Prevention and Control of 
Diabetes
Diet, hypoglycemic drugs, insulin injection 
and exercise are the management options 
based on the type and severity of the condition. 
The overall goal of diabetes management is to 
maintain normal blood glucose level.

Health and Diseases
Dietary management: Low carbohydrate 
and fibre rich diets are more appropriate. 
Carbohydrates should be taken in the form 
of starch and complex sugars. Refined sugars 
(sucrose and glucose) should be avoided. 
Diet comprising whole grains, millets (jowar, 
bajra, ragi), green leafy vegetables, wheat and 
unpolished rice should be included in diet 
regularly.
Carbohydrates is maintained to about 50-
55% of the total calories. High protein content of 
10-15% of the total intake is required to supply 
essential amino acids. Fat content in the diet 
should be 15-25% of the total calories. Saturated 
fat intake should be reduced. Polyunsaturated 
fatty acid content should be higher. 
Management with insulin: Commercially 
available insulin preparations (short and long 
acting) are also used to maintain blood glucose 
levels. 
Physical activity: Exercise plays an important 
role in facilitating a good control of diabetes, 
in addition to strengthening and toning up the 
muscles. 
Education and Awareness: People with 
diabetics should be educated on the nature 
of disease they have and the possibility of 
complications of the disease, if blood sugar 
is not kept under control. Instructions 
regarding diet, exercise and drugs should be 
explained.
Info bits
Flax seeds containing insoluble fibre, 
Guavas, Tomatoes and Spinach are foods 
which help reduce blood sugar levels.
 21.9  Obesity 
Obesity is the state in which there is 
an accumulation of excess body fat with 
an abnormal increase in body weight. 
Obesity is a complex multifactorial chronic 
disease developing from influence of social, 
behavioural, psychological, metabolic and 
cellular factors.
Obesity occurs if intake of calories is 
more than the expenditure of energy. Over 
weight and obesity are conditions where the 
body weight is greater than the mean standard 
weight for age and height of an individual. 
Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of body 
fat and health risk.  
BMI = Weight (kg) / Height (m)

More to Know
Every 7 calories of excess consumption 
leads to 1 gm fat deposit and increase in 
body weight. Weight due to fat in adipose 
tissue exceeds more than 20% to 25 % of 
body weight. An adult weighing 10% more 
than the standard weight is OVERWEIGHT 
and 20% more is OBESE.

Causes and risk factors: Obesity is due to 
genetic factors, physical inactivity, eating 
habits (overeating) and endocrine factors. 
Obesity is a positive risk factor in development 
of hypertension, diabetes, gall bladder disease, 
coronary heart disease and arthritis. 
21.9.1  Prevention and Control of 
Obesity
Diet Management: Low calorie, normal 
protein, vitamins and mineral, restricted 
carbohydrate and fat, high fiber diet can 
prevent overweight. Calorie restriction for 
weight reduction is safe and most effective.
Physical exercise: A low calorie diet 
accompanied by moderate exercise will be 
effective in causing weight loss. Meditation, 
yoga and physical activity can also reduce 
stress related to overeating. 
 21.10  Heart Disease
Cardiovascular 
disease 
(CVD) 
is 
associated with diseases of the heart and 
blood vessels. Coronary heart disease (CHD) 
is the most common form and is caused by 
deposition of cholesterol in the blood vessels. 
It usually develops slowly over many years 
beginning from childhood, they may form a 
fatty streak to a fibrous complicated plaque. It 
leads to the narrowing of blood vessels leading 
to atherosclerosis in the large and medium 
sized arteries that supply the heart muscle with 
oxygen. It leads to sudden ischemia (deficient 
blood supply to heart muscle) and myocardial 
infarction (death of the heart muscle tissue).
More to Know
Desirable level for blood cholesterol 
should be less than 200 mg/dl for Indians. 
The risk of coronary heart disease increases 
slowly as blood cholesterol levels increases 
from 200 to 300 mg/dl.
Risk factors: Hypercholesterolemia (High 
blood cholesterol) and high blood pressure 
(Hypertension) are the major causes and 
contributing factors for heart disease and if 
untreated may cause severe damage to brain, 
kidney and eventually lead to stroke.
Causes: Heredity (family history), diet rich in 
saturated fat and cholesterol, obesity, increasing 
age, cigarette smoking, emotional stress, sedentary 
lifestyle, excessive alcohol consumption and 
physical inactivity are some of the causes. 
Symptoms: Shortness of breath, headache, 
tiredness, dizziness, chest pain, swelling of leg, 
and gastrointestinal disturbances. 
HDL 
(High 
Density 
Lipoprotein) 
or 
"good" 
cholesterol lowers risk of 
heart disease while LDL (Low 
Density Lipoprotein) or "bad" cholesterol 
increases risk of heart disease.
21.10.1  Prevention and Control 
of Heart Disease
Diet management: Reduction in the intake of 
calories, low saturated fat and cholesterol rich 
food, low carbohydrates and common salt are 
some of the dietary modifications. Diet rich in 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is essential. 
Increase in the intake of fibre diet, fruits and 
vegetables, protein, minerals and vitamin are 
required.
Physical activity: Regular exercise, walking and 
yoga are essential for body weight maintenance 
Addictive substance avoidance: Alcohol 
consumption and smoking are to be avoided. 
 Activity 3
Prepare a chart showing the food items 
which are preferable and which should be 
avoided to prevent high blood pressure and 
heart disease. Apart from diet what are the 
other lifestyle modifications to be followed

 21.11  Cancer
Cancer causes about 4 million deaths 
annually throughout the world. In India more 
than one million people suffer from cancer. 
Cancer is derived from Latin word meaning 
crab. The study of cancer is called Oncology 
(Oncos- Tumor).
Cancer is an abnormal and uncontrolled 
division of cells that invade and destroy 
surrounding tissue forming a tumor or neoplasm 
(new growth). It is a heterogenous group of cells 
that do not respond to the normal cell division. 
The cancerous cells migrate to distant parts 
of the body and affect new tissues. This process 
is called metastasis. The frequent sites of 
metastasis are lungs, bones, liver, skin and brain.

21.11.1 Types of Cancers
Cancers are classified on the basis of the 
tissues from which they are formed. 
1. Carcinomas arise from epithelial and 
glandular tissues. They include cancers of 
skin, lung, stomach and brain. About 85% of 
the tumours are carcinomas  
2. Sarcomas are occur in the connective and 
muscular tissue. They include the cancer 
of bones, cartilage, tendons, adipose tissue 
and muscles. These form 1% of all tumours. 
3. Leukaemia are characterized by an 
increase in the formation of white blood 
cells in the bone marrow and lymph nodes. 
Leukaemia are called blood cancers. Most 
common type of cancer which also affect 
children below 15 years of age. 
21.11.2 Carcinogenic Agents
Cancer 
causing 
agents 
are 
called 
carcinogens. They are physical, chemical 
agents, ionizing radiations and biological 
agents. 
Physical Irritant: Heavy smoking causes lung 
cancer and cancers of oral cavity, pharynx 
(throat) and larynx. Betel and tobacco chewing 
causes oral cancer. Excessive exposure to 
sunlight may cause skin cancer.
Chemical agents: Nicotine, caffeine, products 
of combustion of coal and oil, pesticides, 
asbestos, nickel, certain dyes and artificial 
sweetners induce cancer. 
Radiations: Ionizing radiations like X-rays, 
gamma- rays, radioactive substances and non-
ionising radiations like UV rays cause DNA 
damage leading to cancer. 
Biological agents: Cancer causing viruses are 
called oncogenic viruses. 
21.11.3 Treatment of Cancer
The treatment of cancer involves the 
following methods:
Surgery: Tumours are removed by surgery to 
prevent further spread of cancer cells.
Radiation therapy: Tumour cells are irradiated 
by lethal doses of radiation while protecting 
the surrounding normal cells. 
Chemotherapy: It involves administration 
of anticancerous drugs which prevent cell 
division and are used to kill cancer cells. 
Immunotherapy: 
Biological 
response 
modifiers like interferons are used to activate 
the immune system and help in destroying the 
tumors.

Types of Tumours
Benign tumours or Non malignant 
tumours: Remain confined in the organ 
affected and do not spread to other parts of 
the body.
Malignant 
tumours: 
Mass 
of 
proliferating cells which grow very rapidly 
invading and damaging the surrounding 
normal tissues.

Cancer
Cancer control programmes should 
focus on primary prevention and early 
detection.
To prevent lung cancer tobacco smoking 
is to be avoided and protective measures to be 
taken against exposure to toxic pollutants of 
industries. Excessive exposure to radiation is 
to be avoided to prevent skin cancer.
 21.12   AIDS (Acquired 
Immunedeficiency 
Syndrome) 
AIDS is a severe viral disease and caused 
by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). It 
is a condition in which immune system fails 
and suppress the body’s disease fighting 
mechanism. They attack the lymphocytes and 
the affected individual is prone to infectious 
diseases. 
Dr. Suniti Solomon, pioneered 
HIV research and treatment 
in India. She set up the first 
voluntary testing and counselling 
centre and an AIDS Research group in Chennai 
during 80's. Her team was the first to document 
evidence of HIV infection in India in 1985 
(First Indian AIDS patient in Chennai).
21.12.1 Transmission of HIV 
AIDS virus has been found in urine, tears, 
saliva, breast milk and vaginal secretions. The 
virus is transmitted by an infected patient 
who comes in contact with blood of a healthy 
person. HIV/AIDS is not transmitted by touch 
or any physical contact. It spreads through 
contact of body fluids or blood. 
HIV is transmitted generally by 
(i) 
Sexual contact with infected person
(ii) Use of contaminated needles or syringes 
especially in case of intravenous drug 
abusers
