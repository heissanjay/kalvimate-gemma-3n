       INTRODUCTION
Sound plays a major role in our lives. 
We communicate with each other mainly 
through sound. In our daily life, we hear 
a variety of sounds produced by different 
sources 
like 
humans, 
animals, 
vehicle 
horns, etc. Hence, it becomes inevitable to 
understand how sound is produced, how it 
is propagated and how you hear the sound 
from various sources. It is sometimes 
misinterpreted that acoustics only deals with 
musical instruments and design of auditoria 
and concert halls. But, acoustics is a branch 
of physics that deals with production, 
transmission, reception, control, and effects 
of sound. You have studied about propagation 
and properties of sound waves in IX standard. 
In this lesson we will study about reflection 
of sound waves, Echo and Doppler effect. 
 5.1  SOUND WAVES
When you think about sound, the questions 
that arise in your minds are: How is sound 
produced? How does sound reach our ears from 
various sources? What is sound? Is it a force or 
energy? Let us answer all these questions.
By touching a ringing bell or a musical 
instrument while it is producing music, you can 
conclude that sound is produced by vibrations.
The vibrating bodies produce energy in the 
form of waves, which are nothing but sound 
waves (Figure 5.1).

Suppose you and your friend are on the 
Moon. Will you be able to hear any sound 
produced by your friend? As the Moon does 
not have air, you will not be able to hear any 
sound produced by your friend. Hence, you 
understand that the sound produced due 
to the vibration of different bodies needs a 
material medium like air, water, steel, etc, for 
its propagation. Hence, sound can propagate 
through a gaseous medium or a liquid medium 
or a solid medium. 
 ACTIVITY  1
Take a squeaky toy or old mobile phone 
and put it inside a plastic bag. Seal the bag 
with the help of a candle or with a thread. 
Fill a bucket with water and place the bag in 
the water bucket and squeeze the toy or ring 
the mobile. You will hear a low sound. Now 
place your ear against the side of the bucket 
and squeeze the toy or ring the mobile 
phone again. You will hear a louder sound. 
5.1.1 Longitudinal Waves
Sound waves are longitudinal waves 
that can travel through any medium (solids, 
liquids, gases) with a speed that depends 
on the properties of the medium. As sound 
travels through a medium, the particles of 
the medium vibrate along the direction of 
propagation of the wave. This displacement 
involves the longitudinal displacements of 
the individual molecules from their mean 
positions. This results in a series of high and 
low pressure regions called compressions and 
rarefactions as shown in figure 5.2.
Figure 5.2 Sound propagates as  
longitudinal waves
5.1.2  Categories of sound waves 
based on their frequencies
(i) Audible waves – These are sound 
waves with a frequency ranging between 
20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. These are generated by 
vibrating bodies such as vocal cords, stretched 
strings etc.
(ii) Infrasonic waves – These are sound 
waves with a frequency below 20 Hz that cannot 
be heard by the human ear. e.g., waves produced 
during earth quake, ocean waves, sound produced 
by whales, etc.
(iii) Ultrasonic waves – These are sound 
waves with a frequency greater than 20 kHz, 
Human ear cannot detect these waves, but 
certain creatures like mosquito, dogs, bats, 
dolphins can detect these waves. e.g., waves 
produced by bats.

5.1.4 Velocity of sound waves
When you talk about the velocity 
associated with any wave, there are two 
velocities, namely particle velocity and wave 
velocity. SI unit of velocity is ms-1

Acoustics
Particle velocity:
The velocity with which the particles of the 
medium vibrate in order to transfer the energy 
in the form of a wave is called particle velocity.
Wave velocity:
The velocity with which the wave travels 
through the medium is called wave velocity. In 
other words, the distance travelled by a sound 
wave in unit time is called the velocity of a sound 
wave.
∴ Velocity = 
Distance
Time taken
If the distance travelled by one wave is 
taken as one wavelength (λ) and, the time taken 
for this propagation is one time period (T), then, 
the expression for velocity can be written as
 
∴ V = λ
T 
(5.1)
Therefore, velocity can be defined as the 
distance travelled per second by a sound wave. 
Since, Frequency (n) =1/T, equation (5.1) can 
be written as
 
V = nλ  
(5.2)
Velocity of a sound wave is maximum in 
solids because they are more elastic in nature 
than liquids and gases. Since, gases are least 
elastic in nature, the velocity of sound is the 
least in a gaseous medium.
So, 
vS > vL > vG
5.1.5   Factors affecting velocity 
of sound
In the case of solids, the elastic properties 
and the density of the solids affect the velocity 
of sound waves. Elastic property of solids is 
characterized by their elastic moduli. The speed of 
sound is directly proportional to the square root 
of the elastic modulus and inversely proportional 
to the square root of the density. Thus the velocity 
of sound in solids decreases as the density 
increases whereas the velocity of sound increases 
when the elasticity of the material increases. In 
the case of gases, the following factors affect the 
velocity of sound waves.
Effect of density: The velocity of sound in a 
gas is inversely proportional to the square root 
of the density of the gas. Hence, the velocity 
decreases as the density of the gas increases. 
v  √
1
d
Effect of temperature: The velocity of sound in 
a gas is directly proportional to the square root 
of its temperature. The velocity of sound in a 
gas increases with the increase in temperature. v 
∝ √T. Velocity at temperature T is given by the 
following equation:
vT = (vo + 0.61 T) ms–1
Here, vo is the velocity of sound in the 
gas at 0° C. For air, vo = 331 ms–1. Hence, the 
velocity of sound changes by 0.61 ms–1 when the 
temperature changes by one degree celsius.
Effect of relative humidity: When humidity 
increases, the speed of sound increases. That is 
why you can hear sound  from long distances 
clearly during rainy seasons.
Speed of sound waves in different media are 
given in table 5.1.

Solution:
Let To C be the required temperature. Let v1 
and v2 be the velocity of sound at temperatures 
T1K and T2K respectively. T1 = 273K (0o C) and 
T2 = (To C + 273)K

 5.2  REFLECTION OF SOUND
When you speak in an empty room, you hear 
a soft repetition of your voice. This is nothing 
but the reflection of the sound waves that you 
produce. Let us discuss about the reflection of 
sound in detail through the following activity.
When sound waves travel in a given 
medium and strike the surface of another 
medium, they can be bounced back into the 
first medium. This phenomenon is known 
as reflection. In simple the reflection and 
refraction of sound is actually similar to the 
reflection of light. Thus, the bouncing of sound 
waves from the interface between two media 
is termed as the reflection of sound. The waves 
that strike the interface are termed as the 
incident wave and the waves that bounce back 
are termed as the reflected waves, as shown in 
Figure 5.3
Figure 5.3 Reflection of sound
5.2.1 Laws of reflection
Like light waves, sound 
waves 
also 
obey 
some 
fundamental laws of reflection. 
The following two laws of 
reflection are applicable to 
sound waves as well.
 The incident wave, the normal to the 
reflecting surface and the reflected wave 
at the point of incidence lie in the same 
plane.
 The angle of incidence ∠i is equal to the 
angle of reflection ∠r.  
These laws can be observed from Figure 5.4.
Figure 5.4 Laws of reflection
In the above Figure 5.4, the sound waves 
that travel towards the reflecting surface are 
called the incident waves. The sound waves 
bouncing back from the reflecting surface 
are called reflected waves. For all practical 
purposes, the point of incidence and the point 
of reflection is the same point on the reflecting 
surface.
A perpendicular line drawn at the point 
of incidence is called the normal. The angle 
which the incident sound wave makes with 
the normal is called the angle of incidence, 
‘i’. The angle which the reflected wave 
makes with the normal is called the angle of 
reflection, ‘r’.

Acoustics
Acoustical 
wonder 
of 
Golconda fort (Hyderabad, 
Telangana)
The Clapping portico in Golconda 
Fort is a series of arches on one side, 
each smaller than  the preceding one. So, 
a sound wave generated under the dome 
would get compressed and then bounce 
back amplified sufficiently to reach a 
considerable distance.
5.2.2  Reflection at the boundary 
of a denser medium
A 
longitudinal 
wave 
travels in a medium in the 
form of compressions and 
rarefactions. 
Suppose 
a 
compression travelling in air 
from left to right reaches a 
rigid wall. The compression exerts a force F on 
the rigid wall. In turn, the wall exerts an equal and 
opposite reaction R = – F on the air molecules. 
This results in a compression near the rigid wall. 
Thus, a compression travelling towards the rigid 
wall is reflected back as a compression. That is the 
direction of compression is reversed (Figure 5.5).
Figure 5.5 Reflection of sound at a denser 
medium
5.2.3  Reflection at the boundary 
of a rarer medium
Consider 
a 
wave 
travelling in a solid medium 
striking on the interface 
between the solid and the 
air. The compression exerts a 
force F on the surface of the 
rarer medium. As a rarer medium has smaller 
resistance for any deformation, the surface of 
separation is pushed backwards (Figure 5.6). 
As the particles of the rarer medium are free to 
move, a rarefaction is produced at the interface. 
Thus, a compression is reflected as a rarefaction 
and a rarefaction travels from right to left.
   5.6 Reflection of sound at a rarer medium
More to know:
What is meant by rarer and denser medium?
The medium in which the velocity of sound 
increases compared to other medium  is 
called  rarer medium. (Water is rarer 
compared to air for sound).
The medium in which the velocity of sound 
decreases compared to other medium  is 
called  denser medium. (Air is denser 
compared to water for sound)
5.2.4   Reflection of sound in 
plane and curved surfaces
When sound waves are reflected from a 
plane surface, the reflected waves travel in a 
direction, according to the law of reflection. 
The intensity of the reflected wave is neither 
decreased nor increased. But, when the sound 
waves are reflected from the curved surfaces, 
the intensity of the reflected waves is changed. 
When reflected from a convex surface, the 
reflected waves are diverged out and the 
intensity is decreased. When sound is reflected 
from a concave surface, the reflected waves 
are converged and  focused at a point. So the 
intensity of reflected waves is concentrated at 
a point. Parabolic surfaces are used when it is 
required to focus the sound at a particular point. 
Hence, many halls are designed with parabolic 
reflecting surfaces. In elliptical surfaces, sound 
from one focus will always be reflected to the 
other focus, no matter where it strikes the wall.

10th Standard Science
This principle is used in designing whispering 
halls. In a whispering hall, the speech of a 
person standing in one focus can be heard 
clearly by a listener standing at the other focus.
Whispering Gallery
One of the famous whispering 
galleries is in St. Paul’s cathedral 
church in London. It is built with elliptically 
shaped walls. When a person is talking at one 
focus, his voice can be heard distinctly at the 
other focus. It is due to the multiple reflections 
of sound waves from the curved walls.
5.3  ECHOES
An echo is the sound reproduced due 
to the reflection of the original sound from 
various rigid surfaces such as walls, ceilings, 
surfaces of mountains, etc. 
If you shout or clap near a mountain or 
near a reflecting surface, like a building you 
can hear the same sound again. The sound, 
which you hear is called an echo. It is due 
to the reflection of sound. One does not 
experience any echo sound in a small room. 
This does not mean that sound is not reflected 
in a small room. This is because smaller rooms 
do not satisfy the basic conditions for hearing 
an echo.
5.3.1   Conditions necessary for 
hearing echo
1.  The persistence of hearing for human 
ears is 0.1 second. This means that you 
can hear two sound waves clearly, if the 
time interval between the two sounds is at 
least 0.1 s. Thus, the minimum time gap 
between the original sound and an echo 
must be 0.1 s.
2.  The above criterion can be satisfied only 
when the distance between the source of 
sound and the reflecting surface would 
satisfy the following equation:
distance travelled by sound
time taken
2d
t
vt
2
Velocity =
v
d
=
=
Since, t = 0.1 second, then d 
v × 0.1

v

=
=
Thus the minimum distance required to 
hear an echo is 1/20th part of the magnitude 
of the velocity of sound in air. If you 
consider the velocity of sound as 344 ms–1, 
the minimum distance required to hear an 
echo is 17.2 m. 
5.3.2 Applications of echo
  Some animals communicate with each 
other over long distances and also locate 
objects by sending the sound signals and 
receiving the echo as reflected from the 
targets. 
  The principle of echo is used in obstetric 
ultrasonography, which is used to create 
real-time visual images of the developing 
embryo or fetus in the mother’s uterus. 
This is a safe testing tool, as it does not use 
any harmful radiations.
  Echo is used to determine the velocity of 
sound waves in any medium.
5.3.3   Measuring velocity of 
sound by echo method
Apparatus required:
A source of sound pulses, a measuring 
tape, a sound receiver, and a stop watch.

Acoustics
Procedure:
1.  Measure the distance ‘d’ between the 
source of sound pulse and the reflecting 
surface using the measuring tape.
2.  The receiver is also placed adjacent to the 
source. A sound pulse is emitted by the 
source. 
3.  The stopwatch is used to note the time 
interval between the instant at which 
the sound pulse is sent and the instant at 
which the echo is received by the receiver. 
Note the time interval as ‘t’. 
4.  Repeat the experiment for three or four 
times. The average time taken for the given 
number of pulses is calculated. 
Calculation of speed of sound:
The sound pulse emitted by the source 
travels a total distance of 2d while travelling 
from the source to the wall and then back to 
the receiver. The time taken for this has been 
observed to be ‘t’. Hence, the speed of sound 
wave is given by:
 
distance travelled

 5.4   APPLICATIONS 
REFLECTION OF SOUND
5.4.1 Sound board
These are basically curved surfaces 
(concave), which are used in auditoria and 
halls to improve the quality of sound. This 
board is placed such that the speaker is at the 
focus of the concave surface. The sound of the 
speaker is reflected towards the audience thus 
improving the quality of sound heard by the 
audience. 
5.4.2 Ear trumpet
Ear trumpet is a hearing aid, which is 
useful by people who have difficulty in hearing. 
In this device, one end is wide and the other 
end is narrow. The sound from the sources fall 
into the wide end and are reflected by its walls 
into the narrow part of the device. This helps in 
concentrating the sound and the sound enters 
the ear drum with more intensity. This enables 
a person to hear the sound better.  
5.4.3 Mega phone
A megaphone is a horn-shaped device 
used to address a small gathering of people. Its 
one end is wide and the other end is narrow. 
When a person speaks at the narrow end, the 
sound of his speech is concentrated by the 
multiple reflections from the walls of the tube. 
Thus, his voice can be heard loudly over a long 
distance. 
 5.5  DOPPLER EFFECT
The whistle of a fast moving train 
appears to increase in pitch as it approaches a 
stationary listener and it appears to decrease 
as the train moves away from the listener. 
This apparent change in frequency was first 
observed and explained by Christian Doppler 
(1803-1853), an Austrian Mathematician and 
Physicist. He observed that the frequency of 
the sound as received by a listener is different 
from the original frequency produced by the 
source whenever there is a relative motion 
between the source and the listener. This 
is known as Doppler effect This relative 
motion could be due to various possibilities 
as follows:
(i) 
 The listener moves towards or away from a 
stationary source
(ii)  The source moves towards or away from a 
stationary listener

(iii)  Both source and listener move towards or 
away from one other
(iv)  The medium moves when both source and 
listener are at rest
DEFINITION
When ever there is a relative motion 
between a source and a listener, the 
frequency of the sound heard by the listener 
is different from the original frequency of 
sound emitted by the source. This is known 
as “Doppler effect”.
 For simplicity of calculation, it is assumed 
that the medium is at rest. That is the velocity 
of the medium is zero. 
Let S and L be the source and the listener 
moving with velocities vS and vL respectively. 
Consider the case of source and listener 
moving towards each other (Figure 5.7). As the 
distance between them decreases, the apparent

Suppose the medium (say wind) is 
moving with a velocity W in the direction of 
the propagation of sound. For this case, the 
velocity of sound, ‘v’ should be replaced with 
(v + W). If the medium moves in a direction 
opposite to the propagation of sound, then ‘v’ 
should be replaced with (v – W).

5. At what speed should a source of sound 
move away from a stationary observer 
so that observer finds the apparent 
frequency equal to half of the original 
frequency?
Solution: When the source is moving away from 
the stationary listener, the expression for the 
apparent frequency is
n'  =

Acoustics
5.5.1   Conditions for no Doppler 
effect
Under the following circumstances, there 
will be no Doppler effect and the apparent 
frequency as heard by the listener will be the 
same as the source frequency.
(i)  When source (S) and listener (L) both are 
at rest.
(ii)  When S and L move in such a way 
that distance between them remains 
constant.
(iii)  When source S and L are moving in 
mutually perpendicular directions.
(iv)  If the source is situated at the center 
of the circle along which the listener is 
moving.
5.5.2   Applications of Doppler 
effect
(a) To measure the speed of an automobile 
An electromagnetic wave is emitted by 
a source attached to a police car. The wave 
is reflected by a moving vehicle, which acts 
as a moving source. There is a shift in the 
frequency of the reflected wave. From the 
frequency shift, the speed of the car can be 
determined. This helps to track the over 
speeding vehicles.
(b) Tracking a satellite 
The frequency of radio waves emitted by 
a satellite decreases as the satellite passes away 
from the Earth. By measuring the change in 
the frequency of the radio waves, the location 
of the satellites is studied. 
(c)  RADAR 
(RAdio 
Detection 
And 
Ranging)
In RADAR, radio waves are sent, and the 
reflected waves are detected by the receiver 
of the RADAR station. From the frequency 
change, the speed and location of the aeroplanes 
and aircrafts are tracked.
(d) SONAR
In SONAR, by measuring the change in 
the frequency between the sent signal and 
received signal, the speed of marine animals 
and submarines can be determined. 
Points to Remember
 
 Wave velocity is the velocity with which 
the wave travels through the medium.
 
 Velocity of a sound wave is maximum in 
solids because they are more elastic in 
nature than liquids and gases. Since gases 
are least elastic in nature.
 
 Infrasonic waves are sound wave with 
a frequency below 20 Hz. A human ear 
cannot hear these waves.
 
 Ultrasonic waves are sound waves with 
frequency greater than 20 kHz, A human 
ear cannot detect these waves.
 
 Reflection of sound waves obey the laws of 
reflection.
 
 when a compression hits the boundary 
of a rarer medium, it is reflected as a 
rarefaction.
 
 An echo is the sound reproduced due to 
the reflection of the original sound wave. 
 
 The minimum distance between the 
source and the reflecting surface should 
be 17.2 m to hear an echo clearly.
 
 “The apparent frequency” is the frequency 
of the sound as heard by the listener.
