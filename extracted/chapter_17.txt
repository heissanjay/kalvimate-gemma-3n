       Introduction 
“Living organisms cannot survive for 
an indefinite period on earth.  All living 
organisms have the ability to produce more of 
its own kind by the process called reproduction. 
Reproduction is the unfolding of   life forms 
where  new  individuals are formed. It ensures 
continuity and survival of the species. This 
process is to preserve individual species 
and it is called as self-perpetuation. The 
time required to reproduce also varies from 
organism to organism. You may find great 
variations in period of reproduction in yeast, 
bacteria, rat, cow, elephant and humans. In 
sexual reproduction offsprings are produced 
by the union of  male and female  gametes 
(sperm and egg). The male and female gametes 
contain the genetic material or genes present 
on the chromosomes which transmit the 
characteristic traits to the next generation. 
There are three types of reproduction in 
plants namely i) Vegetative ii) Asexual and 
iii) Sexual reproduction.  
 17.1   Vegetative Reproduction
In this type, new plantlets are formed 
from vegetative (somatic) cells, buds or organs 
of plant. The vegetative part of  plant (root, 
stem, leaf or bud) gets detached from the 
parent body and grows into an independent

daughter plant. It has only mitotic division, 
no gametic fusion and daughter plants are 
genetically similar to the parent plant.
Vegetative reproduction may take place 
through
(i) Leaves: In Bryophyllum small plants grow 
at the leaf notches
Leaf notches
Figure 17.1 Vegetative reproduction by leaf
(ii) Stems: In strawberry aerial weak stems 
touch  the ground and give off adventitious 
roots and buds. When the connections with 
the parent plant is broken, the offspring 
beomes independent.
Figuer 17.2 Vegetative reproduction by stem
(iii) Root: Tuberous roots (Asparagus and 
Sweet potato) can be used for vegetative 
propagation.
(iv) Bulbils: In some plants the flower buds 
modified into globose which are called as 
bulbils. When these falls on the ground they 
grow into new plants. e.g. Agave.
(v) Other types of Vegetative Reproduction
a. Fragmentation: In filamentous algae, 
breaking of the filament into many fragments 
is called fragmentation. Each fragment having 
shoot
atleast one cell, may give rise to a new filament 
of the algae by cell division e.g. Spirogyra. 
Figure 17.3 Fragmentation in Spirogyra
b. Fission: In this type the parent cell divides 
into two daughter cells and each cell develops 
into a new adult organism e.g. Amoeba.
Figure 17.4 Fission in Amoeba
c. Budding: Formation of a daughter individual 
from a small projection, the bud, arising on the 
parent body is called budding. e.g. Yeast.
Figure 17.5 Budding in Yeast
d. Regeneration: The ability of the lost body 
parts of an individual  organism to give rise to 
an whole new  organism  is called regeneration. 
It takes place by specialized mass of cells e.g 
Hydra and Planaria.

Reproduction in Plants and Animals
 17.2   Asexual Reproduction
Production of an offspring by a single 
parent without the formation and fusion of 
gametes is called asexual reproduction. It 
involves only mitotic cell divisions and meiosis 
does not occur. Offspring produced by asexual 
reproduction are not only identical to parents 
but are also exact copies of their parent.
Asexual reproduction occurs by spore 
formation. This is the most common method 
of asexual reproduction in fungi and bacteria. 
During spore formation a structure called 
sporangium develops from the fungal hypha. 
The nucleus divides several times within the 
sporangium and each nucleus with small 
amount of cytoplasm develops into a spore. The 
spores are liberated and they develop into new 
hypha after reaching the ground or substratum.

 Wet a slice of bread, and keep it in a 
cool, moist and dark place.
 
 Observe the surface of the slice with a 
magnifying glass.
 
 Record your observations for a week.
 17.3   Sexual Reproduction in 
Plants
Sexual reproduction is the process in 
which two gametes (male and female) are 
fused to produce offspring of their own kind. 
In such cases both sexes, male and female 
sex organs are needed to produce gametes. 
You have already learnt that the flower is a 
reproductive organ of a flowering plant. 
To understand this further we need to study 
the structure of a flower.
17.3.1 Parts of a Typical Flower
A flower is a modified shoot with limited 
growth to carry out sexual reproduction. A 
flower consists of four whorls borne on a 
thalamus. These whorls are from outside
a) Calyx – consisting of sepals
b) Corolla – consisting of petals
c) Androecium – consisting of stamens
d)  Gynoecium or pistil – consisting of carpels
Figure 17.7 Parts of a flower
 Activity 2
 
 Take a shoe flower from a growing plant.
 
 Observe the floral parts Calyx, Corolla, 
Androecium and Gynoecium.
 
 Separate the stamens and carpels and 
observe the parts.
 
 Dust the pollen grains on a slide and 
observe under a microscope.
The two outermost whorls calyx and corolla 
are non–essential or accessory whorls as they 
do not directly take part in the reproduction. The 
other two whorls androecium and gynoecium 
are known as the essential whorls, because both 
take  part directly in reproduction.
Androecium: Androecium, the male part of 
flower is composed of stamens. Each stamen 
consists of a stalk called the filament and a 
small bag like structure called anther at the tip. 
The pollen grains are produced in the anther 
within the pollen sac.

Pollen Grain
Pollen grain: Pollen grains are usually spherical 
in shape. It has two layered wall. The hard-
outer layer is known as exine. It has prominent 
apertures called germpore. The inner thin layer is 
known as intine. It is a thin and continuous layer 
made up of cellulose and pectin. Mature pollen 
grains contain two cells, the vegetative and the 
generative cell. Vegetative cell contains a large 
nucleus. The generative cell divides mitotically to 
form two male gametes.
Gynoecium: Gynoecium is 
the female part of the flower 
and is made up of carpels. It 
has three parts:
1. Ovary
2. Style
3. Stigma
The ovary contains the 
ovules.
17.3.2 Structure of the Ovule
The main part of the ovule is the nucellus 
which is enclosed by two integuments leaving 
an opening called as micropyle. The ovule is 
attached to the ovary wall by a stalk known as 
funiculus. Chalaza is the basal part.

Three cells at the micropylar end form the egg 
apparatus and the three cells at the chalaza end 
are the antipodal cells. The remaining two nuclei 
are called polar nuclei found in the centre. In the 
egg apparatus one is the egg cell (female gamete) 
and the remaining two cells are the synergids. 
Process 
of 
sexual 
reproduction 
in 
flowering plants. It involves:
1. Pollination
2. Fertilization
 17.4  Pollination
The transfer of pollen 
grains from anther to stigma of 
a flower is called as pollination
Importance of Pollination
1. It results in fertilization 
which leads to the formation of fruits and 
seed.
2. New varieties of plants are formed through 
new combination of genes in case of cross 
pollination.
17.4.1 Types of Pollination
1. Self-pollination
2. Cross pollination
Self-pollination (Autogamy)
Self-pollination is also known as autogamy. 
The transfer of pollen grains from the anther 
to the stigma of same flower or another flower 
borne on the same plant is known as self-
pollination. e.g. Hibiscus.
Advantages of self-pollination
1. Self-pollination is possible in  bisexual 
flowers.
2. Flowers do not depend on agents for 
pollination.
3. There is no wastage of pollen grains.

Reproduction in Plants and Animals
Disadvantages of self-pollination
1. The seeds are less in numbers.
2. The endosperm is minute. Therefore, the 
seeds produce weak plants.
3. New varieties of plants cannot be produced
Cross pollination
Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen 
from the anthers of a flower to the stigma of 
a flower on another plant of the same species 
e.g. apples, grapes, plum, etc.
Advantages of cross pollination
1. The seeds produced as a result of cross 
pollination, 
develop 
and 
germinate 
properly and grow into better plants, i.e. 
cross pollination leads to the production of 
new varieties.
2. More viable seeds are produced.
Disadvantages of cross-pollination
1. Pollination may fail due to distance barrier.
2. More wastage of pollen grains
3. It may introduce some unwanted characters
4. Flowers depend on the external agencies 
for pollination
 Activity 3
 
 Observe the flowers in a garden. 
Identify the insects and birds that act as 
pollinating agents. 
 
 Maintain a record of  pollinating agents 
and the plants.
 17.5   Agents of Cross 
Pollination
In order to bring about cross pollination, 
it is necessary that the pollen should be carried 
from one flower to another of a different plant. 
This takes place through the agency of animals, 
insects, wind and water.
1. Pollination by wind 
The pollination with the help of wind is 
called anemophily. The anemophilous flowers 
produce enormous amount of pollen grains. 
The pollen grains are small, smooth, dry and 
light in weight. Pollen of such plants are blown 
off at a distance of  more than 1,000 km. The 
stigmas are comparatively large, protruding 
and sometimes hairy to trap  the pollen grains. 
e.g. Grasses and some cacti.
2. Pollination by insects
Pollination with the help of insects like 
honey bees, flies are called entomophily. 
To attract insects these flowers are brightly 
coloured, have smell and nectar. The pollen 
grains are larger in size, the exine is pitted, 
spiny etc., so they can be adhered firmly on 
the sticky stigma. Approximately, 80% of the 
pollination done by the insects is carried by 
honey bees.
3. Pollination by water 
The pollination with the help of water is 
called hydrophily.This takes place in aquatic 
plants.
(i) 
Pollen grains are produced in large 
numbers.
(ii) Pollen grains float on surface of water till 
they land on the stigma of female flowers 
e.g. Hydrilla, Vallisneria.

3. Pollination by Animals
When pollination takes place with the 
help of animals, it is called Zoophily. Flowers 
of such plants attract animals by their bright 
color, size, scent etc. e.g. sun bird pollinates 
flowers of Canna, Gladioli etc., Squirrels 
pollinate flowers of silk cotton tree.

 Pollen grains reach the right stigma and 
begin to germinate.
 
 Pollen grain forms a small tube-like 
structure called pollen tube which emerges 
through the germ pore. The contents of 
the pollen grain move into the tube.
 
 Pollen tube grows through the tissues of 
the stigma and style and finally reaches 
the ovule through the micropyle.
 
 Vegetative cell degenerates and the 
generative cell divides to form two sperms 
(or male gametes).
 
 Tip of pollen tube bursts and the two 
sperms enter the embryo sac.
 
 One sperm fuses with the egg (syngamy) 
and forms a diploid zygote. The other sperm 
fuses with the secondary nucleus (Triple 
fusion) to form the primary endosperm 
nucleus which is triploid in nature. Since 
two types of fusion syngamy and triple 
fusion take place in an embryo sac the 
process is termed as double fertilization.
 
 After triple fusion, primary endosperm 
nucleus develops into an endosperm.
 
 Endosperm 
provides 
food 
to 
the 
developing embryo.
 
 Later the synergids and antipodal cells 
degenerate.
Significance of Fertilization
(i) 
It stimulates the ovary to develop into 
fruit.
(ii) It helps in development  of new characters 
from two different individuals.
Post fertilization changes:
1. The ovule develops into a seed.
2. The integuments of the ovule develop into 
the seed coat.
3. The ovary enlarges and develops into a fruit.
The seed contains the future plant or 
embryo which develops into a seedling under 
appropriate conditions.
 17.7   Sexual Reproduction in 
Human
You have studied the structural details of 
the male and female reproductive system  in 
9th standard. In human beings the male and 
female reproductive organs differ anatomically 
and physiologically. New individuals develop 
by the fusion of gametes. Sexual reproduction 
involves the fusion of two haploid gametes 
(male and the female gametes) to form a 
diploid individual (zygote). 
Organs of the reproductive system are 
divided into primary and secondary (accessory) 
sex organs.

17.7.2.  Female Reproductive 
Organ - Structure of Ovary 
The ovaries are  located on either side of 
the lower abdomen composed of two almond 
shaped bodies, each lying near the lateral end 
of fallopian tube. Each ovary is a compact 
structure consisting of an outer cortex and an 
inner medulla. The cortex is composed of a 
network of connective tissue called as stroma 
and is lined by the germinal epithelium. 
The epithelial cells called the granulosa cells 
surround  each  ovum in the ovary together 
forming the primary follicle. As the egg grows 
larger,  the follicle also enlarges and gets filled 
with the fluid and is called the Graafian 
follicle.    
 
 Primary reproductive organs include the 
gonads (Testes in male and Ovaries in 
female). 
 
 Accessory sex organs 
 
 Male: Vas deferens, epididymis, seminal 
vesicle, prostate gland and penis. 
 
 Female: Fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix 
and  vagina.
The secondary (accessory) sex organs 
include those structures which are involved 
in the 
 
 Process of ovulation 
 
 Fusion of the male and female gametes 
(fertilization) 
 
 Division of the fertilized egg upto the 
formation of embryo
 
 Pregnancy
 
 Development of  foetus 
 
 Child birth. 
Now let’s see the cells of the primary 
reproductive organs in human male and 
female and their role in reproduction.
17.7.1  Male Reproductive Organ  - 
Structure of Testes
Testes are the reproductive glands of the 
male that are oval shaped organs which lie 
outside the abdominal cavity of a man in a sac 
like structure called scrotum. Now we shall 
study the various cells which are present in the 
testes.
Each testes is covered with a layer of 
fibrous tissue called tunica albuginea. Many 
septa  from this layer divide the testes  into 
pyramidal   lobules, in which lie seminiferous 
tubules, cells of Sertoli, and the Leydig cells 
(interstitial cells). 
The process of spermatogenesis takes 
place in the seminiferous tubules. The 
Sertoli cells are the supporting cells and 
provide nutrients to the developing sperms. 
The Leydig cells are polyhedral in shape and 
Info bits
The  number of primordial follicles in new 
born female child ranges over 7 million and 
during reproductive period (at puberty) the 
number is around 60,000 to 70,000. During a 
woman’s lifetime, she will only ovulate 300 to 
400 of the 1-2 million eggs, she was initially 
born with. On the other side, men will produce 
over 500 billion sperms in their lifetime.

 17.8  Gametogenesis
The formation of the sperm in male and 
the ovum in female is called gametogenesis. 
It involves spermatogenesis (formation of 
spermatozoa) and oogenesis (the formation of 
ova). Gametes with haploid cells are produced 
through gametogenesis.  
17.8.1  Structure of Human 
Sperm 
The spermatozoan consists of head, a 
middle piece and tail. The sperm head is 
elongated and formed by the condensation 
of nucleus. The anterior portion has a cap 
like structure called acrosome. It contains 
hyaluronidase an enzyme that helps the 
sperm to enter the ovum during fertilization. 
A short neck  connects the head and middle 
piece which comprises the centrioles.The 
middle piece contains the mitochondria 
which provides energy for the movement of 
tail. It brings about sperm motility  which is 
essential for fertilization.
17.8.2 Structure of Human Ovum 
The mature ovum or egg is spherical 
in shape.The ovum is almost free of yolk. It 
contains abundant cytoplasm and the nucleus. 
The ovum  is surrounded by three membranes. 
The plasma membrane is surrounded by inner 
thin zona pellucida and  an outer thick corona 
radiata. The corona radiata is formed of follicle 
cells.  The membrane forming the surface layer 
of the ovum is called vitelline membrane. The 
fluid-filled space between zona pellucida  and 
the surface of the egg is called perivitelline 
space.

Puberty 
The reproductive system in both males 
and females becomes functional and an 
increase in  sex hormone production resulting 
in puberty. This phenomenon tends to start 
earlier in females than in males. Generally 
boys attain puberty between the age  of 13 to 
14 years,  while girls reach puberty between 
11 to 13 years.  In male, the onset of puberty 
is triggered by the secretion of the hormone 
testosterone in the testes, in female the 
secretion of estrogens and progesterone from

the ovary. The secretion of both male and 
female hormones are under the control of the 
pituitary gonadotropins luteinizing hormone 
(LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).
 17.9   Menstrual Cycle-Process 
of Ovulation
The cyclic events that take place in a 
rhythmic fashion during the reproductive 
period of a woman’s life is called menstrual 
cycle. In human females the menstrual cycle 
starts at the age of 11-13 years which marks the 
onset of puberty and is called menarche, and 
ceases around 48-50 years of age and this stage 
is termed menopause. The reproductive period 
is marked by characteristic events repeated 
almost every month in physiologically normal 
women  (28 days with minor variation) in the 
form of a menstrual flow. The menstrual cycle 
consists of 4 phases 
1. Menstrual or Destructive Phase
2. Follicular or Proliferative Phase 
3. Ovulatory Phase  
4. Luteal or Secretory Phase

induced by the pituitary hormones (LH and 
FSH) and ovarian hormones (estrogen and 
progesterone).
Info bit
Menstruation  is a periodical phenomenon 
that continues from puberty to menopause. 
This will happen if the released ovum is not 
fertilized by the sperm.  Lack of menstruation 
generally indicates pregnancy. 
 17.10   Fertilization to Foetal 
Development
Fertilization
Fertilization in human is internal and 
occurs in the oviduct of the female genital 
tract.  It takes place usually in the ampulla of 
the fallopian tube. An oocyte is alive for about 
24 hours after it is released  from the follicle. 
Fertilisation must take place within 24 hours. 
The sperm enters  into the ovum and fuses 
with it, resulting  in the formation of a ‘zygote’. 
This process is called fertilization. The zygote 
is a fertilized ovum. 
Cleavage and Formation of Blastula
The first cleavage takes place about 30 
hours after fertilization. Cleavage is a series 
of rapid mitotic divisions of the zygote to 
form many celled blastula (Blastocyst) which 
comprises an outer layer of smaller cells and 
inner mass of larger cells. 
Implantation 
The blastocyst (fertilized egg) reaches 
the uterus and gets implanted in the uterus. 
The process of attachment of the blastocyst 
to the uterine wall (endometrium) is called 
implantation. The fertilized egg becomes 
implanted in about 6 to 7 days after fertilization.
Gastrulation 
The transformation of blastula into 
gastrula and the formation of primary germ 
layers (ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm) 
by rearrangement of the cells is called 
gastrulation. This takes place after the process 
of implantation.
Figure 17.18 Developmental stages of zygote 
from cleavage to blastocyst formation
Organogenesis
The establishment of the germ layers 
namely ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm 
initiates the final phase of embryonic 
Info bits
Normally one egg matures in the ovary 
each month. Ovulation is the rupture of 
the follicle releasing the egg or ovum . 
The uterus prepares itself to receive the 
fertilized egg every month. The uterine 
lining becomes thick and spongy for 
implantation of the fertilized egg. 
Events leading to when fertilization 
occurs and does not occur
If fertilization takes place  the corpus 
luteum persists, continues to  secrete 
progesterone maintains the thickened state 
of uterine  wall and prevents maturation of 
another follicle till the end of pregnancy 
If fertilization does not occur, corpus 
luteum degenerates, the egg disintegrates 
and the uterine lining slowly breaks, 
discharged as blood and mucus  leading to 
menstrual events.

development. 
During 
organogenesis 
the 
various organs of the foetus are established 
from the different germ layers attaining a 
functional state.
Formation of Placenta 
The placenta is a disc shaped structure 
attached to the uterine wall and is a temporary 
association between the developing embryo 
and maternal tissues. It allows the exchange of 
food materials, diffusion of oxygen, excretion of 
nitrogenous wastes and elimination of carbon 
dioxide. A cord containing blood vessels that 
connects the placenta with the foetus  is called 
the umbilical cord. 
Pregnancy (Gestation)
It is the time period during which the 
embryo attains its development in the uterus. 
Normally gestation period of human last for 
about 280 days. During pregnancy the uterus 
expands upto 500 times of its normal size.
Parturition (Child Birth)
Parturition is the expulsion of young 
one from the mother’s uterus at the end 
of gestation. Oxytocin from the posterior 
pituitary stimulates the uterine contractions 
and provides force to expel the baby from the 
uterus, causing birth.
Sometimes ovaries releases 
two eggs and each is fertilised 
by a different sperm, resulting in 
Non-Identical Twins (Fraternal 
Twins). If single egg is fertilised and then divides 
into two foetus, Identical Twins develop.
Lactation
The process of milk production after child 
birth from mammary glands of the mother is 
called lactation.  The first fluid which is released 
from the mammary gland after  child birth is 
called as colostrum. Milk production from 
alveoli of mammary glands is stimulated by 
prolactin secreted from the anterior pituitary. 
The ejection of milk is stimulated by posterior 
pituitary hormone oxytocin. 
Info bits
The milk produced from the breast during 
the first 2 to 3 days after child birth  is called 
colostrum. It contains immune substances 
and provides immunity to the new born 
which is essential for the body. 
 17.11.  Reproductive Health
According to World Health Organization 
(WHO) reproductive health means a total well 
being in all aspects of reproduction, ability to 
reproduce and regulate fertility, women's ability to 
undergo pregnancy and safe child birth,maternal 
and infant survival and well being.  
Several measures were undertaken by the 
government to improve the reproductive health 
of the people by launching National Health 
Programmes such as the 
i. Family Welfare Programme 
ii. Reproductive and Child Health Care (RCH) 
Programme 
Family welfare programme: The National 
Family Welfare Programme is a comprehensive 
scheme which includes: 
1. Maternal and child health care (MCH)
2. Immunization of mothers, infants and 
children.
3. Nutritional supplement to pregnant women 
and children.
4. Contraception with health education, to 
motivate couples to accept contraceptive 
methods and to have small family norms, 
which improve economic status, living 
status and the quality of life.
Reproductive and Child Health Care (RCH) 
Programme: It has integrated all services 
which include 
 • Pregnancy and child birth 
 • Postnatal care of the mother and child

 • Importance of breast feeding
 • Prevention of reproductive tract infections 
and sexually transmitted diseases.
 17.12   Population Explosion 
and Family Planning
Population explosion defined as the 
sudden and rapid rise in the size of population, 
especially human population. Realizing the 
dangers inherent in population growth, 
the Government of India has taken several 
measures to check population growth and 
introduced family planning. India has been 
one of the first country in the world  to launch 
the nation wide family planning programme 
in 1952.
Family planning is a way of living that is 
adopted voluntarily by couples on the basis of 
knowledge and responsible decisions to promote 
the health and welfare of the family group and 
society. The WHO (World Health Organisation) 
has also stressed the importance of family 
planning as global strategy health for all. 
The inverted red triangle 
is a symbol of family planning 
in India for family welfare. It 
is displayed prominently at all hospitals, 
primary health clinics and family welfare 
centres where any help or advice about family 
planning is available free of cost. The symbol 
is displayed along with a slogan Small Family, 
Happy Family.  
17.12.1. Contraception
Contraception is one of the best birth 
control measures. A number of techniques 
or methods have been developed to prevent 
pregnancies in women. The devices used 
for contraception are called contraceptive 
devices. Common contraceptive methods 
used to prevent pregnancy are discussed here. 
1. Barrier methods
2. Hormonal methods
3. Intra-Uterine Devices (IUDs)
4. Surgical methods
Barrier Methods 
This method  prevents sperms from meeting 
the ovum. Its entry into the female reproductive 
tract is prevented by barrier.
(a) Condom: Condom prevents deposition 
of sperms in the vagina. Condoms are made 
of thin rubber or  latex sheath. Condom also 
protect against sexually transmitted diseases 
(STD) like syphilis, AIDS.
(b) Diaphragm (Cervical cap): Vaginal 
diaphragm fitting into the vagina or a cervical 
cap fitting over the cervix. This prevents the 
entry of sperms into the uterus.  
Hormonal Methods
Hormonal preparations are in the form of 
pills or tablets (contraceptive pills). These 
hormones stop (interfere with ovulation) the 
release of egg from the ovary.
Intra-Uterine Devices (IUDs)
The 
intrauterine 
device 
(IUD) 
are 
contraceptive devices inserted into the uterus. 
There are two synthetic devices commonly 
used in India are Lippe’s Loop and Copper-T 
made of copper and plastic (non irritant). This 
can remain for a period 
of 3 years. This reduces 
the 
sperm 
fertilizing 
capacity and prevents 
implantation. This also 
helps to give adequate 
time interval  between 
pregnancies.
Surgical Methods
Surgical contraception or sterilization 
techniques are terminal methods to prevent any 
pregnancy. This procedure in males is vasectomy 
(ligation of vas deferens) and in females it is

tubectomy (ligation of fallopian tube). These 
are methods of permanent birth control. 
 17.13   Urinary Tract Infection 
(UTI)
Many diseases affect both women and men, 
but a few  diseases occur at a higher frequency 
in woman.  Woman are susceptible to  UTI from 
the bacteria that are present on  skin, rectum 
or vagina. This will enter the urethra, before 
moving upwards. The types of UTI are: 
1. Cystitis or Bladder infection
Bacteria lodged in the urinary bladder 
thrive and multiply leading to inflammation. 
It is most common in the age group of 20 to 50.
2. Kidney Infection
The bacteria can travel from the urinary 
bladder and upward to ureter and affect one 
or both the kidneys.  It also infects the blood 
stream and leads to serious life-threatening 
complications.
3. Asymptomatic Bacteriuria
The bacteria present in the urinary bladder 
which may not show any symptoms.
 17.14  Personal Hygiene
Hygiene is the practice of healthy living 
and personal cleanliness. Personal hygiene is 
caring of one’s own body and health. Social 
hygiene is proper care of the surrounding 
environment. The main aspect of hygiene are 
body hygiene, food hygiene, sanitary hygiene 
and hygienic environment.  
17.14.1 Body Hygiene 
Washing is vital to all age group of people 
which maintains our personal hygiene.  A daily 
bath regularly keeps skin clean and free of 
germs. Hair should be kept clean by frequent 
washing. Mouth wash should be done after 
every meal. We should wash our hands many 
times during the day. 
Cloth towels used to dry our  hands or 
body should be dried  after each use and 
laundered regularly. Clothes, handkerchief, 
undergarments and  socks should be washed 
daily. Washing prevents body odour, infections 
and skin irritation.
17.14.2 Toilet Hygiene
The toilet has a lot to do with personal 
hygiene and general health as it is a place that 
cannot be avoided and used regularly. Parents 
should guide and practice their children on 
how  to use the toilets at home, in schools and 
other public places so that it will protect the 
children from various contagious infections 
and diseases.The following measures can 
ensure toilet hygiene   
1. The floors of the toilet should be maintained 
clean and dry. This  helps to reduce the bad 
odour and also infection.
2. Toilet flush handles, door knobs, faucets, 
paper towel dispensers, light switches and 
walls should be cleaned with disinfectants 
to kill harmful germs and bacteria.
3. Hands should be washed thoroughly with 
soap before and after toilet use.
17.14.3  Menstrual and Napkin 
Hygiene
Women’s health depends upon the  level 
of cleanliness to keep them free from skin and 
genitourinary tract infection.
Menstrual hygiene
Maintaining 
menstrual 
hygiene 
is 
important for the overall health of women. The 
basic menstrual hygiene ways are
1. Sanitary pads should be changed regularly, 
to avoid infections due to microbes from 
vagina and sweat from genitals.
2. Use of warm water  to clean  genitals helps 
to get rid of menstrual cramps.

More to Know
Every year May 28 is observed as Menstrual 
Hygiene day to make girls and women 
aware of maintaining menstrual hygiene and 
importance of menstrual hygiene for good 
health. By way of awareness through films, 
discussions and campaigns menstrual hygiene 
has taken quite the centre stage in recent days. 
Napkin hygiene
The parents and teachers are to create 
awareness among the school girls  about the 
use of napkins and their proper disposal. Girls 
should be educated  in the following ways 
1. The sanitary pad and tampons should be 
wrapped properly and discarded  because 
they can spread  infections.
2. Sanitary pad or tampon should not be 
flushed down the toilet. 
3. Napkin incinerators are to be used  properly 
for  disposal of used napkins.
Info bits
The menstrual hygiene scheme to provide 
subsidized sanitary napkins was launched 
by the Health ministry in 2011. 
In Tamil Nadu, UNICEF has developed 
an affordable incinerator that uses firewood 
to handle sanitary napkin waste at schools 
and special wells are equipped where 
sanitary napkins are composted.  
Points to Remember
 

Many bacteria and protozoa simply divide 
into two or more daughter cells by fission.
 

Organisms such as hydra can regenerate 
if they are broken into pieces. They can 
also give out buds which mature into new 
individuals.
 

Reproduction in flowering plants involves 
transfer of pollen grains from the anther 
to the stigma which is referred to as 
pollination. This is followed by fertilization.
 

Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of 
two haploid gametes (male and the female 
gametes) to form a diploid individual 
(zygote). 
 

The formation of the sperm in male and the 
ovum in female is called gametogenesis. It 
involves spermatogenesis (formation of 
spermatozoa) and oogenesis (the formation 
of ova). 
 

The cyclic events that take place in a 
rhythmic manner during the reproductive 
period of a woman’s life is called menstrual 
cycle.
 

The process of attachment of the blastocyst 
to the uterine wall (endometrium) is called 
implantation.
 

The placenta is a temporary association 
between the developing embryo and 
maternal tissues.
 

Parturition is the expulsion of  young one 
from the mother’s uterus.
 

Contraception is one of the best birth control 
measures. The devices used for contraception 
are called contraceptive devices.
