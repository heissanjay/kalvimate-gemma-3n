      Introduction 
“Like Begets Like” is an important and 
universal phenomenon of life as the living 
beings produce offspring of their own kind. 
Colour of eye, color of hair, shape of nose, type 
of earlobe, etc, are inheritable traits. Have you 
ever wondered, how do we inherit traits and 
characteristics from our father and  mother? 
Some of our characteristics might have been 
inherited from our grandparents. How do 
we inherit characters from one generation to 
another? It is because of the genes we inherit 
from our parents. These genes  are responsible 
for the physical outlook and biological 
functions. The branch of biology  that deals 
with the genes, genetic variation and heredity 
of living organisms is called genetics. 
Heredity is transmission of characters, 
from one generation to the next generation, 
while variation refers to the differences shown 
by the individuals of the same species and also 
by the offspring of the same parents. All these 
can happen only due to chromosomes. Now 
let’s see what chromosomes are and how they 
are composed with DNA, that form the genetic 
material. 
 18.1   Gregor Johann Mendel - 
Father of Genetics
Mendel (1822-1884) was an Austrian monk 
who discovered the basic principles of heredity 
through his experiments. His experiments are 
the foundation for modern genetics. He was 
born in 1822 to a family of farmers in Silesian of 
Czechoslovakia. After finishing his high school

at the age of 18, he entered the Augustinian 
Monastery at Brunn as a priest. From there he 
went to the University of Vienna for training 
in physics, mathematics and natural science. 
Mendel returned to the monastery in 1854 
and continued to work as a priest and teach  in 
high school. In his leisure time he started his 
famous experiments on the garden pea plant. 
He conducted his experiments in the monastery 
for about seven years from 1856 to 1863. He 
had worked on nearly 10000 pea plants of 34 
different varieties. Mendel noted that they differ 
from one another in many ways. 
Thus Mendel had chosen 7 pairs of 
contrasting characters for his study as shown 
in the table.

Reasons for Mendel’s success  
He chose the pea plant as it was 
advantageous for experimental work in many 
aspects 
1. It is naturally self-pollinating  and so is very 
easy to raise pure breeding individuals. 
2. It has a short life span as it is an annual 
and so it was  possible to follow several 
generations. 
3. It is easy to cross-pollinate. 
4. It has deeply defined contrasting characters. 
5. The flowers are bisexual. 
 18.2   Monohybrid Cross – 
Inheritance of One Gene 
Crosses involving inheritance of only 
one pair of contrasting characters are called 
monohybrid crosses. For example it is a cross 
between two forms of a single trait like a cross 
between tall and dwarf plant. 
Mendel’s Explanation of Monohybrid Cross 
Parental generation: Pure breeding tall plant 
and a pure breeding dwarf plant. 
F1 generation: Plants raised from the seeds of 
pure breeding parental cross in F1 generation 
were tall and monohybrids. 
F2 generation: Selfing of the F1 monohybrids 
resulted in tall and dwarf plants respectively 
in the ratio of 3:1. The actual number of tall 
and dwarf plants obtained by Mendel was 787 
tall and 277 dwarf. External expression of a 
particular trait is known as phenotype. So the 
phenotypic ratio is  3:1. 
In the F2 generation 3 different types were 
obtained: 
Tall Homozygous 
– TT (Pure) – 1 
Tall Heterozygous 
– Tt – 2 
Dwarf Homozygous – tt – 1 
So the genotypic ratio 1:2:1. A genotype is the 
genetic constitution of an organism
Mendel’s Interpretation on Monohybrid 
cross 
Based on these observations it was 
confirmed by  Mendel that  ‘factors’  are passed 
on from one generation to another, now 
refered to as genes. Tallness and Dwarfness 
are determined by a pair of contrasting factors 
, tall plant possess a pair of factors (represented 
by T- taking the first letter of the dominant 
character) and a plant is dwarf because it 
possess factors for dwarfness (represented as 
t- recessive character). These factors occur

Genetics
in pairs and may be alike as in pure breeding 
tall plants (TT) and dwarf plants (tt). This is 
referred to as homozygous. If they are  unlike 
(Tt) they are  referred to as heterozygous. 
1. Two factors making up a pair of 
contrasting characters are called alleles. 
Phenotypic expression of alleles are called 
allelomorphs. One member of each pair is 
contributed by one parent. 
2. When 
two 
factors 
for 
alternative 
expression of a trait are brought together 
by fertilization. The character which 
expresses itself is called dominant 
(Tallness) condition and that which is 
masked is called recessive condition 
(Dwarfness). 
3. The factors are always pure and when 
gametes are formed, the unit factors 
segregate so that each gamete gets one of 
the two alternative factors. It means that 
factors for tallness(T) and dwarfness(t) are 
separate entities and in a gamete either T 
or t is present. When F1 hybrids are self 
crossed  the two entities separate and then 
unite independently, forming tall and dwarf 
plants. 
 18.3   Dihybrid Cross-
Inheritance Two Genes 
and Law of Independent 
Assortment
Dihybrid cross involves the inheritance 
of two pairs of contrasting characteristics 
(or contrasting traits) at the same time. The 
two pairs of contrasting characteristics chosen 
by Mendel were shape and colour of seeds: 
round-yellow seeds and wrinkled-green 
seeds. 
Mendel crossed pea plants having round-
yellow seeds with pea plants having wrinkled-
green seeds. Mendel made the following 
observations: 
1. Mendel first crossed pure breeding  pea 
plants having round-yellow seeds with 
pure breeding  pea plants having wrinkled-
green seeds and found that only round-
yellow seeds were produced in the first 
generation (F1). No wrinkled-green seeds 
were obtained in the F1 generation. From 
this it was concluded that round shape and 
yellow colour of the seeds were dominant 
traits over the wrinkled shape and green 
color of the seeds.
2. When the hybrids of F1 generation pea 
plants having round-yellow seeds were 
cross-bred by self pollination, then four 
types of seeds having different combinations 
of shape and color were obtained in second 
generation or F2 generation. They were 
Figure 18.1 Monohybrid cross


264
10th Standard Science
round yellow, round-green, wrinkled 
yellow and wrinkled-green seeds. 
The ratio of each phenotype (or appearance) 
of seeds in the F2 generation is 9:3:3:1. 
This is known as the Dihybrid ratio.
From the above results it can be 
concluded that the factors for each character 
or trait remain independent and maintain 
their identity in the gametes. The factors are 
independent to each other and pass to the 
offsprings (through gametes). 
Results of a Dihybrid Cross: 
Mendel got the following results from his 
dihybrid cross 
1. Four Types of Plants: A dihybrid cross 
produced four types of F2 offsprings in the 
ratio of 9 with two dominant traits, 3 with 
one dominant trait and one recessive trait, 
3  with another dominant trait and another 
recessive trait and 1 with two recessive traits. 
2. New Combination: Two new combinations 
of traits with round green and wrinkled 
yellow had appeared in the dihybrid cross 
(F2 generation).  
 18.4  Mendel’s Laws
Based on his experiments of monohybrid 
and dihybrid cross, Mendel proposed three 
important laws which are now called as 
Mendel’s Laws of Heredity. 
• 
Law of Dominance: 
“When two homozygous individuals 
with one or more sets of contrasting 
characters are crossed, the characters that 
appear in the F1 hybrid are dominant and 
those that do not appear in F1 are recessive 
characters". 
• 
Law of Segregation or Law of purity of 
gametes: 
“When a pair of contrasting factors are 
brought together in a F1 hybrid. The two 
factors of the allelic pair remain together 
without mixing and when gametes are 
formed, the two separate out, so that only 
one enters each gamete.” 
• 
Law of independent assortment: 
“In case of inheritance of two or more 
pairs of characters simultaneously, the

More to Know
T.H. Morgan was awarded Nobel Prize in 
1993 for determining the role of chromosomes 
in heredity.
 18.5   Chromosomes, DNA 
and Genes 
The human body  is made up of million 
cells. The nucleus of each cell contains thin 
thread like structures called chromosomes. 
The term ‘chromosomes’ was first coined by 
Waldeyer in 1888. The chromosomes are the 
carrier of genetic material which contain the 
heredity information.
The chromosomes are highly condensed 
coiled chromatin fibres packed with the 
DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) that  forms the 
genetic material. Genes are segments of DNA, 
which are responsible for the inheritance 
of a particular phenotypic character. Each 
gene is present at a specific position on a 
chromosome called its locus. During cell 
division, the genetic  information present in 
the genes are passed from one generation to 
another.
18.5.1  Structure of a Chromosome
The chromosomes are thin, long and 
thread like structures consisting of two identical 
strands called sister chromatids. They are held 
together by the centromere. Each chromatid is 
made up of  spirally coiled thin structure called 
chromonema. The chromonema has number of 
bead-like structures along its length which are 
called chromomeres.  The chromosomes are 
made up of DNA,RNA, chromosomal proteins 
(histones and non-histones) and certain metallic 
ions. These proteins provide structural support 
to the chromosome .
A chromosome consists of the following 
regions
Primary constriction: The two arms of a 
chromosome meet at a point called primary 
constriction or centromere. The centromere 
is the region where spindle fibres attach to the 
chromosomes during cell division.
Secondary constriction: Some chromosomes 
possess secondary constriction at any point 
of the chromosome. They are known as 
the nuclear zone or nucleolar organizer 
(formation of nucleolus in the nucleus).
Telomere: The end of the chromosome is  called 
telomere. Each extremity of the chromosome 
has a polarity and prevents it from joining 
the adjacent chromosome. It maintains and 
provides stability to the chromosomes. 
Satellite: Some of the chromosomes have an 
elongated  knob-like  appendage at one end 
of the chromosome  known as satellite. The 
chromosomes with satellites are called as the 
sat-chromosomes.
Telomeres act as aging clock 
in every cell.
Telomeres 
are 
protective 
sequences 
of 
nucleotides 
found 
in 
chromosomes. As a cell divides every time, 
they become shorter. Telomeres get too 
short to do their job, causing our cells to age.

18.5.2  Types of Chromosomes 
based on the position of 
Centromere
Based on the position of centromere, the 
chromosomes are classified as Telocentric, 
Acrocentric, Submetacentric and Metacentric
1. Telocentric– The centromere is found on 
the proximal end. They are rod shaped 
chromosomes.
2. Acrocentric – The centromere is found at 
the one end with a short arm and a long arm. 
They are also rod-shaped chromosomes.
3. Submetacentric – The centromere is 
found near the centre of the chromosome. 
Thus forming two unequal arms. They are J 
shaped or L shaped chromosomes.
4. Metacentric – The centromere occurs in 
the centre of the chromosome and form two 
equal arms. They are V shaped chromosomes
18.5.3  Types  of Chromosomes 
based on function 
The eukaryotic chromosomes are classified 
into autosomes and allosomes. 
Autosomes contain genes that determine 
the somatic (body) characters. Male  and 
female  have equal number of autosomes.  
Allosomes 
are 
chromosomes 
which 
are responsible for  determining the sex of 
an individual. They are also called as sex 
chromosomes or hetero-chromosomes. There 
are two types of sex  chromosomes, X and 
Y- chromosomes. Human males have one X 
chromosome and one Y chromosome and 
human females have two  X chromosomes. 
18.5.4 Karyotype
The number of chromosomes in any living 
organism (animal or plant) is constant. In 
human, each cell normally contains 23 pairs 
of chromosomes. Out of which 22 pairs are 
autosomes and the 23rd pair is the  allosome or 
sex chromosome.
In the body cells of sexually reproducing 
organisms, the chromosomes generally occur 
in pairs. This condition is called diploid (2n). 
The gametes produced by the organisms 
contain a single set of chromosomes. Hence, 
the gametes are said to be haploid (n).
Karyotype is the number, size and shape of 
chromosomes in the cell nucleus of an organism. 
Idiogram is the diagrammatic representation 
of karyotype of a species. It consists of all 
the metaphasic chromosomes arranged in 
homologous pairs according to decreasing 
length, thickness, position of centromere, shape 
etc., with the sex chromosomes placed at the end.

Chargaff rule of DNA base pairing
Erwin Chargaff states that in DNA, the 
proportion of adenine is always equal to that 
of thymine. and the proportion of guanine 
always equal to that of cytosine. 
accepted model of DNA is the 
double helical structure  of 
James Watson and Francis 
Crick. They proposed the 
three-dimensional model of 
DNA on the basis of X-ray 
diffraction studies of DNA obtained by Rosalind 
Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. In appreciation 
of their discoveries on the molecular structure 
of nucleic acids Watson, Crick and Wilkins were 
awarded Nobel prize for Medicine in 1962.
Chemical Composition of DNA molecule 
DNA is a large molecule consisting of 
millions of nucleotides. Hence, it is also called 
a polynucleotide. Each nucleotide consists of 
three components.
1. A sugar molecules – Deoxyribose sugar.
2. A nitrogenous base. 
There are two types of nitrogenous bases in 
DNA. They are
(a) Purines (Adenine and Guanine) 
(b) Pyrimidines (Cytosine and Thymine)
3. A phosphate group
Nucleoside and Nucleotide
Nucleoside = Nitrogen base + Sugar
Nucleotide = Nucleoside + Phosphate
The nucleotides are formed according to 
the purines and pyrimidines present in them.

molecule 
consists 
of 
two 
polynucleotide chains.
2. These chains form a double helix structure 
with two strands which run anti-parallel 
to one another. 
3. Nitrogenous bases in the centre are linked 
to sugar-phosphate units which form the 
backbone of the DNA.
4. Pairing between the nitrogenous bases is 
very specific and is always between purine 
and pyrimidine linked by hydrogen bonds.

18.6.2 DNA Replication
DNA replication is one of the basic process 
that occurs within a cell. DNA molecule 
produces exact copies of its own structure 
during replication process. The two strands 
of a DNA molecule have complementary base 
pairs, the nucleotides of each strand provide the 
information needed to produce its new strand. 
The two resulting daughter cells contain exactly 
the same genetic information as the parent cell. 
DNA replication involves the following steps 
Origin of replication
The specific points on the DNA, where 
the replication begins, is the site of origin of 
replication. The two strands open and separate 
at this point forming the replication fork.
Unwinding of DNA molecule
The enzyme called helicase, bind to the 
origin of replication site. Helicase separates the 
two strands of the DNA. The enzyme called 
topoisomerase separates the double helix above 
the replication fork and removes the twists 
formed during the unwinding process. Each 
of the separated DNA strands function as a 
template.
Formation of RNA primer
An RNA primer is a short segment of 
RNA nucleotides. The primer is synthesized 
by the DNA template close to the origin of 
replication site. 
Synthesis of new complementary strand 
from the parent strand
After the formation of RNA primer, 
nucleotides are added with the help of 
an enzyme DNA polymerase and a new 
complementary strand of DNA is formed from 
each of the parent strand. The synthesis is 
unidirectional. 
In one strand, the daughter strand is 
synthesized as a continuous strand which  is 
called leading strand. In the other strand, short 
segments of DNA are synthesized. This strand 
is called lagging strand. The short segments 
of DNA  are called Okazaki fragments. The 
fragments are joined together by the enzyme, 
DNA ligase.
The replication stops when the replication 
fork of the two sides meet at a site called 
terminus, which is situated opposite to origin 
of replication site

 It contains information required for the 
formation of proteins.
 
 It controls the developmental process and 
life activities of an organism.
 18.7  Sex Determination
The formation of zygote into male or 
female sex during development  is called 
sex determination. Sex is determined by the 
chromosomes of an individual.
18.7.1  Sex Determination in Human
Recall that human beings have 23 pairs 
of chromosomes out of which 22 pairs are 
autosomes and one pair (23rd pair) is the  sex 
chromosome. The female gametes or the 
eggs  formed are similar in their chromosome 
type  (22+XX). Therefore, human females are 
homogametic. 
The male gametes or sperms produced are of 
two types. They are produced in equal proportions. 
The sperm bearing (22+X) chromosomes and the 
sperm bearing (22+Y) chromosomes. The human 
males are called  heterogametic.  
Figure 18.9 Sex determination in human
Female
Male
It is a chance of probability as to which 
category of sperm fuses with the egg. If the 
egg (X) is fused by the X-bearing sperm an 
XX individual (female) is produced. If the 
egg (X) is fused by the Y-bearing sperm an 
XY individual (male) is produced. The sperm, 
produced by the father, determines the sex of 
the child. The mother is not  responsible in 
determining the sex of the child. 
Now let’s see how the chromosomes take 
part in this formation. Fertilization of the egg 
(22+X) with a sperm (22+X) will produce a 
female child (44+XX). while fertilization of the 
egg (22+X) with a sperm (22+Y)  will give rise 
to  a male child (44+XY).  
18.7.2 Mutation 
The term mutation was introduced by 
Hugo De Vries in 1901 when he observed 
phenotypic changes in the evening primrose 
plant, Oenothera lamarckiana. Mutation is 
an inheritable sudden change in the genetic 
material (DNA) of an organism. Mutations 
are classified into two main types, namely 
chromosomal mutation and gene mutation.
1. Chromosomal mutation 
The sudden change in the structure 
or number of chromosomes is called 
chromosomal mutation. This may result in 
(i) 
Changes 
in 
the 
structure 
of 
chromosomes: Structural changes in the 
chromosomes usually occurs due to errors 
in cell division. Changes in the number and 
arrangement of genes takes place as a result of 
deletion, duplication, inversion and translocation 
in chromosomes.
(ii) 
Changes 
in 
the 
number 
of 
chromosomes: They involve addition or 
deletion in the number of chromosomes 
present in a cell. This is called ploidy. There 
are two types of ploidy
(a) Euploidy (b) Aneuploidy.
Euploidy: It is the condition in which the 
individual bears more than the usual number 
of diploid (2n) chromosomes. If an individual 
has three haploid sets of chromosomes, the 
condition is called triploidy (3n). Triploid 
plants and animals are typically sterile.If it 
has four haploid sets of chromosomes, the 
condition is called tetraploidy (4n). Tetraploid 
plants are advantageous as they often result in 
increased fruit and flower size.

Aneuploidy: It is the loss or gain of one 
or more chromosomes in a set. It is of three 
types. Monosomy (2n-1), Trisomy (2n+1)and 
Nullisomy (2n-2). In man, Down’s syndrome is 
one of the commonly known aneuploid condition. 
Down’s syndrome
This condition was first identified by a 
doctor named Langdon Down in1866.
It is a genetic condition in which there is an 
extra copy of chromosome 21 (Trisomy 21). It 
is associated with mental retardation, delayed 
development, behavioural problems, weak 
muscle tone, vision and hearing disability are 
some of the conditions seen in these children. 
Figure 18.11 Aneuploidy
2. Gene or point mutation
Gene mutation is the changes occurring 
in nucleotide sequence of a gene. It involves 
substitution, deletion, insertion or inversion 
of a single or more than one nitrogenous base. 
Gene alteration results in abnormal protein 
formation in an organism. 
Sickle cell anaemia is 
caused by the mutation of a 
single gene. Alteration in the 
gene brings a change in the structure of 
the  protein part of haemoglobin molecule. 
Due to the change in the protein molecule, 
the red blood cell (RBC) that carries the 
haemoglobin is sickle shaped.
Points to Remember
 

Variations are quite apparent among 
closely related groups of organisms. 
 

Mendel had choosen seven pairs of 
distinguishing traits: flower colour, 
position, seed colour, shape, pod colour, 
pod shape, stem length. 
 

Every pea plant has two ‘factors’ which 
are responsible for producing a particular 
character or trait is called allele. 
 

The process of acquiring characters or 
traits from parents is called ‘Heredity’. 
 

Each human cell contains 23 pairs of 
chromosomes. Out of these 22 pairs are 
called autosomes and one pair is called 
allosomes. 
 

A chromosome consists of the regions: 
primary constriction, centromere, secondary 
constriction, telomere and satellite.
 

Based on the position of the centromere, 
the chromosomes are classified as 
telocentric, acrocentric, sub metacentric 
and metacentric chromosomes.
 

Each nucleotide of DNA consists of a 
deoxyribose sugar, a nitrogenous base 
and a phosphate group. Pairing is always 
between a purine and a pyrimidine.
 

The sperm, produced by the father, 
determines the sex of the child. The 
mother is not responsible in determining 
the sex of the child.

Mutation is an inheritable change in the 
genetic material of an organism.

2. Diploid condition - 9:3:3:1
3. Allosome
- 22 pair of chromosome
4. Down’s syndrome - 2n
5. Dihybrid ratio
- 23rd pair of chromosome
V. Answer in a sentence
1.  What is a cross in which inheritance of 
two pairs of contrasting characters are 
studied? 
2.  Name the conditions when both the alleles 
are identical? 
3.  A garden pea plant produces axial white 
flowers. Another of the same species produced 
terminal violet flowers. Identify the dominant 
trait? 
4.  What is the name given to the segments 
of DNA, which are responsible for the 
inheritance of a particular character?
5.  Name the bond which binds the nucleotides 
in a DNA.
VI. Short answers questions
1.  Why did Mendel select pea plant for his 
experiments? 
2.  What do you understand by the term 
phenotype and genotype? 
3. What are allosomes?
4. What are Okazaki fragments?
5.  Why 
is 
euploidy 
considered 
to 
be 
advantageous to both  plants and animals?
6.  A pure tall plant (TT) is crossed with pure 
dwarf plant (tt), what would be the F1 and F2 
generations? Explain. 
7. Explain the structure of a chromosome.
8.  Label the parts of the DNA in the diagram 
given below. Explain the structure briefly.
VII. Long answer questions
1.  Explain with an example the inheritance 
of dihybrid cross. How is it different from 
monohybrid cross?
2.  How is the structure of DNA organised? 
What is the biological  significance of DNA?
3.  The sex of the new born child is a matter of 
chance and neither of the parents may be 
considered responsible for it. What would be 
the possible fusion of gametes to determine 
the sex of the child?
VIII. Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)
1.  Flowers of the garden pea are bisexual and 
self-pollinated. Therefore, it is difficult to 
perform hybridization experiment by crossing 
a particular pistil with the specific pollen 
grains. How Mendel made it possible in his 
monohybrid and dihybrid crosses? 
2.  Pure-bred tall pea plants are first crossed with 
pure-bred dwarf pea plants. The pea plants 
obtained in F1 generation are then selfed to 
produce F2 generation of pea plants. 
a.  What do the plants of F1 generation look 
like? 
b.  What is the ratio of tall plants to dwarf 
plants in F2 generation? 
c.  Which type of plants were missing 
in F1 generation but reappeared in F2 
generation?
