       Introduction 
The word hormone is derived from the 
Greek word “hormon” meaning “ to excite”. 
The function of control and coordination in 
plants is performed by chemical substances 
produced by the plants called plant hormones. 
In plants several cells are capable of producing 
hormones. 
These 
phytohormones 
are 
transported to different parts of the plants to 
perform various physiological functions.
Endocrine glands in vertebrate animals 
possess a diversified communication system 
to co-ordinate physiological and metabolic 
functions by chemical integration. The 
endocrine system acts through chemical 
messengers known as hormones which are 
produced by specialized glands. Physiological 
processes such as digestion, metabolism, 
growth, development and reproduction are 
controlled by hormones. 
 16.1   Plant Hormones
Plant hormones are organic molecules that 
are produced at extremely low concentration in 
plants. These molecules control morphological, 
physiological and biochemical responses.

Types of Plant Hormones
There are five major 
classes of plant hormones. 
They are:
1. Auxins
2. Cytokinins
3. Gibberellins
4. Abscisic Acid (ABA) 
5. Ethylene
Among all these plant hormones auxins, 
cytokinins and gibberellins promote plant 
growth while abscisic acid and ethylene inhibit 
plant growth.
Figure 16.1 Hormonal interaction in plant 
growth and development
16.1.1 Auxins
Auxins (Gk. auxein = to grow) were the 
first plant hormones discovered. The term 
auxin was introduced by Kogl and Haagen-
Smith (1931). Auxins are produced at the tip 
of stems and roots from where they migrate to 
the zone of elongation. Charles Darwin (1880), 
observed unilateral growth and curvature of 
canary grass (Phalaris canariensis) coleoptiles. 
He came to the conclusion that some ‘influence’ 
was transmitted from the tip of the coleoptile 
to the basal region. This ‘influence’ was later 
identified as Auxin by Went.
16.1.1.1 Went’s Experiment
Frits Warmolt Went (1903– 1990), a 
Dutch biologist demonstrated the existence 
and effect of auxin in plants. He did a series of 
experiments in Avena coleoptiles. 
In his first experiment he removed the tips 
of Avena coleoptiles. The cut tips did not grow 
indicating that the tips produced something 
essential for growth.In his second experiment 
he placed the agar blocks on the decapitated 
coleoptile tips. The coleoptile tips did not show 
any response. In his next experiment he placed 
the detached coleoptile tips on agar blocks. 
After an hour, he discarded the tips and placed 
this agar block on the decapitated coleoptile. It 
grew straight up indicating that some chemical 
had diffused from the cut coleoptile tips into 
the agar block which stimulated the growth. 
From his experiments Went concluded 
that a chemical diffusing from the tip of 
coleoptiles was responsible for growth, and he 
named it as “Auxin” meaning ‘to grow”.
Figure 16.2 Went’s Experiment
Types of Auxins: Auxins are classified into 
two types, namely natural auxins and synthetic 
auxins.
1.  Natural Auxins: Auxins produced by 
the plants are called natural auxins. 
Example: IAA (Indole – 3 - Acetic Acid)
2.  Synthetic Auxins: Artificially synthesized 
auxins that have properties like auxins 
are called as synthetic auxins. Example: 2, 
4 D (2,4 Dichlorophenoxy Acetic Acid).
Physiological effects of auxins: Auxins bring 
about a variety of physiological effects in 
different parts of the plant body.

Plant and Animal Hormones
1.  Auxins promote the elongation of stems 
and coleoptiles which makes them to grow.
Auxin
Figure 16.3 Cell Elongation
2.  Auxins induce root formation at low 
concentration and inhibit it at higher 
concentration.
3.  The auxins produced by the apical buds 
suppress growth of lateral buds. This is 
called  apical dominance.
4.  Seedless fruits without fertilization are 
induced by the external application of 
auxins. 
(Parthenocarpy). 
Examples: 
Watermelon, Grapes, Lime etc.
5.  Auxins prevent the formation of abscission 
layer.
Phenyl Acetic Acid (PAA) 
and Indole 3 Acetonitrile (IAN) 
are natural auxins. Indole 3 
Butyric Acid (IBA), Indole-3-
Propionic Acid, α-Naphthalene Acetic Acid 
(NAA), 2, 4, 5-T (2,4,5 Trichlorophenoxy 
Acetic Acid) are some of the synthetic auxins.
16.1.2 Cytokinins
Cytokinins (Cytos - cell; kinesis - division) 
are the plant hormones that promote cell 
division or cytokinesis in plant cells. It was first 
isolated from Herring fish sperm. Zeatin was 
the cytokinin isolated from Zea mays. Cytokinin 
is found abundantly in liquid endosperm of 
coconut.
Physiological effects of cytokinins
1. Cytokinin 
induces 
cell 
division 
(cytokinesis) in the presence of auxins.
2. Cytokinin also causes cell enlargement.
3. Both auxins and cytokinins are essential 
for the formation of new organs from the 
callus in tissue culture (Morphogenesis).
4. Cytokinins promote the growth of lateral 
buds even in the presence of apical bud.
5. Application of cytokinin delays the process 
of ageing in plants. This is called Richmond 
Lang effect.
16.1.3 Gibberellins
Gibberellins are the most abundantly found 
plant hormones. Kurosawa (1926) observed 
Bakanae disease or foolish seedling disease 
in rice crops. This internodal elongation in rice 
was caused by fungus Gibberella fujikuroi. The 
active substance was identified as Gibberellic 
acid.
Physiological effects of gibberellins
1.  Application of gibberellins on plants 
stimulate extraordinary elongation of 
internode. e.g. Corn and Pea.
Bolted shoot
Rosette leaves
Figure 16.4 Bolting
2.  Treatment of rosette plants with gibberellin 
induces sudden shoot elongation followed 
by flowering. This is called bolting.

3.  Gibberellins promote the production 
of male flowers in monoecious plants 
(Cucurbits).
4.  Gibberellins break dormancy of potato 
tubers.
5.  Gibberellins are efficient than auxins in 
inducing the formation of seedless fruit - 
Parthenocarpic fruits (Development of 
fruits without fertilization) e.g. Tomato.
16.1.4 Abscisic Acid
Abscisic acid (ABA) is a growth inhibitor 
which regulates abscission and dormancy. It 
increases tolerance of plants to various kinds 
of stress. So, it is also called as stress hormone. 
It is found in the chloroplast of plants. 
Physiological effects of abscisic acid
1. ABA promotes the process of abscission 
(separation of leaves, flowers and fruits 
from the branch).
2. During water stress and drought conditions 
ABA causes stomatal closure.

3. ABA promotes senescence in leaves by 
causing loss of chlorophyll.
4. ABA induces bud dormancy towards the 
approach of winter in trees like birch.
5. ABA is a powerful inhibitor of lateral bud 
growth in tomato.
16.1.5 Ethylene
Ethylene is a gaseous plant hormone. It is 
a growth inhibitor. It is mainly concerned with 
maturation and ripening of fruits. Maximum 
synthesis of ethylene occurs during ripening of 
fruits like apples, bananas and melons 
Physiological effects of ethylene
1. Ethylene promotes the ripening of fruits. 
e.g. Tomato, Apple, Mango, Banana, etc.
Figure 16.6 Ethylene
2. Ethylene inhibits the elongation of stem 
and root in dicots.
3. Ethylene hastens the senescence of leaves 
and flowers.
4. Ethylene 
stimulates 
formation 
of 
abscission zone in leaves, flowers and 
fruits. This leads to premature shedding.
5. Ethylene breaks the dormancy of buds, 
seeds and storage organs.
 16.2  Human Endocrine Glands
Endocrine glands in animals possess a 
versatile communication system to coordinate 
biological functions. Exocrine glands and 
endocrine glands are two kinds of glands found 
in animals. Endocrine glands are found in 
different regions of the body of animals as well as 
human beings. These glands are called ductless 
 Activity
Place two or three unripe tomatoes in a 
brown paper bag with a ripe bananas and roll 
the top closed. In another bag place two or three 
unripe tomatoes only and roll the top closed, 
Observe what happens to the tomatoes? Why?
As the banana continues to ripen in 
the first bag, it produces ethylene gas. The 
gas trapped in the bag will cause tomatoes 
to ripen.The tomatoes remain unripe in the 
second bag.

Plant and Animal Hormones
glands. Their secretions are called hormones 
which are produced in minute quantities. The 
secretions diffuse into the blood stream and are 
carried to the distant parts of the body. They act 
on specific organs which are referred as target 
organs.
The branch of biology which 
deals with the study of the 
endocrine glands and its 
physiology 
is 
known 
as 
‘Endocrinology’. Thomas Addison is 
known as Father of Endocrinology. English 
physiologists W. M. Bayliss and E. H. Starling 
introduced the term hormone in 1909. They first 
discovered the hormone secretin. 
Exocrine glands have specific ducts to 
carry their secretions e.g. salivary glands, 
mammary glands, sweat glands.
Endocrine glands present in human and 
other vertebrates are 
a. Pituitary gland
b. Thyroid gland
c. Parathyroid gland
d. Pancreas (Islets of Langerhans)
e. Adrenal gland (Adrenal cortex and 
Adrenal medulla) 
f. Gonads(Testes and Ovary) 
g. Thymus gland
16.2.1 Pituitary Gland
The pituitary gland or hypophysis 
is a pea shaped compact mass of cells located 
at the base of the midbrain attached to the 
hypothalamus by a pituitary stalk. The pituitary 
gland is anatomically composed of two lobes and 
perform different functions. They are the anterior 
lobe (adenohypophysis) and the posterior lobe 
(neurohypophysis). The intermediate lobe is 
non-existent in humans. 
The pituitary gland forms the major 
endocrine gland in most vertebrates. It regulates 
and controls other endocrine glands and so is 
called as the “Master gland”.
Hormones secreted by the anterior lobe 
(Adenohypophysis) of pituitary
The anterior pituitary is composed of 
different types of cells and secrete hormones 
which stimulates the production of hormones 
by other endocrine glands. The hormones 
secreted by anterior pituitary are 
a. Growth Hormone
b. Thyroid stimulating Hormone 
c. Adrenocorticotropic Hormone
d. Gonadotropic 
Hormone 
which 
comprises 
the 
Follicle 
Stimulating 
Hormone and Luteinizing Hormone
e. Prolactin
a.  Growth hormone (GH)
GH promotes the development and 
enlargement of all tissues of the body. It 
stimulates the growth of muscles, cartilage and 
long bones. It controls the cell metabolism. 
The improper secretion of this hormone 
leads to the following conditions.
Dwarfism: It is caused by decreased 
secretion of growth hormone in children. The 
characteristic features are stunted growth, 
delayed skeletal formation and mental 
disability. 
Gigantism: 
Oversecretion 
of 
growth 
hormone leads to gigantism in children. It is 
characterised by overgrowth of all body tissues 
and organs. Individuals attain abnormal 
increase in height. 
Acromegaly: Excess secretion of growth 
hormone in adults may lead to abnormal 
enlargement of head, face, hands and feet.

b. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)
TSH controls the growth of thyroid 
gland, coordinates its activities and hormone 
secretion.
c. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
ACTH stimulates adrenal cortex of the 
adrenal gland for the production of its hormones. 
It also influences protein synthesis in the adrenal 
cortex.
d. Gonadotropic hormones (GTH) 
The gonadotropic hormones are follicle 
stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone 
which are essential for the normal development 
of gonads.
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
In male, it stimulates the germinal 
epithelium of testes for formation of sperms. 
In female it initiates the growth of ovarian 
follicles and its development in ovary.
Luteinizing hormone (LH)
In male, it promotes the Leydig cells of the 
testes to secrete male sex hormone testosterone. 
In female, it causes ovulation (rupture of mature 
graafian follicle), responsible for the development 
of corpus luteum and production of female sex 
hormones estrogen and progesterone. 
e. Prolactin (PRL)
PRL is also called lactogenic hormone. This 
hormone initiates development of mammary 
glands during pregnancy and stimulates the 
production of milk after child birth.
Hormones secreted by the posterior lobe 
(Neurohypophysis) of pituitary
The hormones secreted by the posterior 
pituitary are 
a. Vasopressin or Antidiuretic hormone 
b. Oxytocin
a.  Vasopressin or Antidiuretic hormone 
(ADH)
In 
kidney 
tubules 
it 
increases 
reabsorption of water. It reduces loss of water 
through urine and hence the name antidiuretic 
hormone. 
Deficiency 
of 
ADH 
reduces 
reabsorption of water and causes an increase 
in urine output (polyuria). This deficiency 
disorder is called Diabetes insipidus. 
b. Oxytocin
It helps in the contraction of the smooth 
muscles of uterus at the time of child birth and 
milk ejection from the mammary gland after 
child birth.
16.2.2 Thyroid Gland
The thyroid gland is composed of two 
distinct lobes lying one on either side of the 
trachea. The two lobes are connected by means 
of a narrow band of tissue known as the isthmus. 
This gland is composed of glandular follicles and 
More to Know
Melatonin is a hormone produced by the 
pineal gland. It is known as a ‘time messenger’. 
It signals night time information throughout 
the body.
 Exposure to light at night, especially 
short-wavelength 
light, 
can 
decrease 
melatonin production interrupting sleep. 
Suppression of melatonin has been implicated 
in sleep disturbances and related metabolic 
disorders.

lined by cuboidal epithelium.The follicles are 
filled with colloid material called thyroglobulin.
An amino acid tyrosine and iodine are 
involved in the formation of thyroid hormone. 
The hormones secreted by the thyroid gland are 
a. Triiodothyronine (T3)
b. Tetraiodothyronine or Thyroxine (T4)
Functions of thyroid hormones
The functions of thyroid hormones are 
 
 Production of energy by maintaining the 
Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) of the body.
 
 Helps 
to 
maintain 
normal 
body 
temperature.
 
 Influences the activity of central nervous 
system.
 
 Controls growth of the body and bone 
formation.
 
 Essential for normal physical, mental and 
personality development . 
 
 It is also known as personality hormone.
 
 Regulates cell metabolism.
More to Know
Edward C. Kendal in 1914 first 
crystallised thyroxine hormone. Charles 
Harrington and George Barger identified 
the molecular structure of thyroxine in 1927. 
Thyroid gland requires “120 µg” of iodine 
everyday for the production of thyroxine.
Thyroid Dysfunction
When the thyroid gland fails to secrete 
the normal level of hormones, the condition 
is called thyroid dysfunction. It leads to the 
following conditions
Hypothyroidism
It is caused due to the decreased secretion of 
the thyroid hormones. The abnormal conditions 
are simple goitre, cretinism and myxoedema.
Goitre
It is caused due to 
the inadequate supply of 
iodine in our diet. This is 
commonly prevalent in 
Himalayan regions due to low level of iodine 
content in the soil. It leads to the enlargement 
of thyroid gland which protrudes as a marked 
swelling in the neck and is called as goitre.
Cretinism
It is caused due to decreased secretion 
of the thyroid hormones in children. The 
conditions are stunted growth, mental defect, 
lack of skeletal development and deformed 
bones. They are called as cretins. 
Myxoedema
It is caused by deficiency of thyroid 
hormones in adults. They are mentally sluggish, 
increase in body weight, puffiness of the face 
and hand, oedematous appearance.
Hyperthyroidism
It is caused due to the excess secretion of 
the thyroid hormones which leads to Grave’s 
disease. The symptoms are protrusion of the 
eyeballs (Exopthalmia), increased metabolic 
rate, high body temperature, profuse sweating, 
loss of body weight and nervousness. 
16.2.3 Parathyroid Gland
The parathyroid glands are four small 
oval bodies that are situated on the posterior 
surface of the thyroid lobes. The chief cells of 
the gland are mainly concerned with secretion 
of parathormone.

Functions of Parathormone
The parathormone regulates calcium and 
phosphorus metabolism in the body.They act 
on bone, kidney and intestine to maintain 
blood calcium levels. 
Parthyroid Dysfunction
The secretion of parathyroid hormone can 
be altered due to the following conditions. 
Removal of parathyroid glands during 
thyroidectomy (removal of thyroid) causes 
decreased secretion of parathormone. The 
conditions are
 •
Muscle spasm known as Tetany (sustained 
contraction of muscles in face, larynx, 
hands and feet).
 •
Painful cramps of the limb muscles.
16.2.4  Pancreas (Islets of 
Langerhans)
Pancreas is an elongated, yellowish gland 
situated in the loop of stomach and duodenum. 
It is exocrine and endocrine in nature. The 
exocrine pancreas secretes pancreatic juice which 
plays a role in digestion while, the endocrine 
portion is made up of Islets of Langerhans.

Human insulin was first 
discovered by Fredrick Banting, 
Charles Best and MacLeod in 
1921. Insulin was first used in 
treatment of diabetes on 11th January 1922.
The Islets of Langerhans consists of two 
types of cells namely alpha cells and beta cells. 
The alpha cells secrete glucagon and beta cells 
secrete insulin. 
Functions of Pancreatic hormones
A balance between insulin and glucagon 
production is necessary to maintain blood 
glucose concentration.
Insulin
 •
Insulin helps in the conversion of glucose 
into glycogen which is stored in liver and 
skeletal muscles.
 •
It promotes the transport of glucose into 
the cells.
 •
It decreases the concentration of glucose 
in blood.
Glucagon
 •
Glucagon helps in the breakdown of 
glycogen to glucose in the liver.
 •
It increases blood glucose levels. 
Diabetes mellitus
The deficiency of insulin causes Diabetes 
mellitus. It is characterised by 
 •
Increase 
in 
blood 
sugar 
level 
(Hyperglycemia).
 •
Excretion of excess glucose in the urine 
(Glycosuria).
 •
Frequent urination (Polyuria).
 •
Increased thirst (Polydipsia).
 •
Increase in appetite (Polyphagia).
16.2.5  Adrenal Gland
The adrenal glands are located above each 
kidney. They are also called supra renal glands.
The outer part is the adrenal cortex and 
the inner part is the adrenal medulla. The two 
distinct parts are structurally and functionally 
different.

Plant and Animal Hormones
Adrenal Cortex
The adrenal cortex consists of three layers 
of cells. They are zona glomerulosa, zona 
fasciculata and zona reticularis
Hormones of Adrenal Cortex
The hormones secreted by the adrenal 
cortex are corticosteroids. They are classified 
into
a. Glucocorticoids 
b. Mineralocorticoids 
Functions of adrenocortical hormones
Glucocorticoids 
The glucocorticoids secreted by the zona 
fasciculata are cortisol and corticosterone 
 •
They regulate cell metabolism.
 •
It stimulates the formation of glucose from 
glycogen in the liver. 
 •
It is an anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic 
agent.
Mineralocorticoids 
The mineralocorticoids secreted by zona 
glomerulosa is aldosterone
 •
It helps to reabsorb sodium ions from the 
renal tubules.
 •
It causes increased excretion of potassium 
ions.
 •
It regulates electrolyte balance, body 
fluid volume, osmotic pressure and blood 
pressure. 
More to Know
The cortisol hormones of adrenal cortex 
serves to maintain the body in living condition 
and recover it from the severe effects of stress 
reactions. Thus an increased output of cortisol 
is “life saving” in “shock conditions”. It is also 
known as life-saving hormone.
Adrenal Medulla 
The adrenal medulla is composed of 
chromaffin cells.They are richly supplied with 
sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. 
Hormones of Adrenal Medulla
It secretes two hormones namely 
a. Epinephrine (Adrenaline) 
b. Norepinephrine (Noradrenaline)
They are together called as “Emergency 
hormones”. It is produced during conditions 
of stress and emotion. Hence it is also referred 
as “flight, fright and fight hormone”.
Functions of adrenal medullary hormones 
Epinephrine (Adrenaline)
 •
It promotes the conversion of glycogen to 
glucose in liver and muscles. 
 •
It increases heart beat and blood pressure. 
 •
It increases the rate of respiration by 
dilation of bronchi and trachea.
 •
It causes dilation of the pupil in eye.
 •
It decreases blood flow through the skin. 
Norepinephrine (Noradrenalin)
Most of its actions are similar to those of 
epinephrine.
16.2.6  Reproductive Glands 
(Gonads)
The sex glands are of two types the testes 
and the ovaries. The testes are present in male, 
while the ovaries are present in female.

10th Standard Science
Testes
Testes are the reproductive glands of the 
males. They are composed of seminiferous 
tubules, Leydig cells and Sertoli cells. Leydig 
cells form the endocrine part of the testes. 
They secrete the male sex hormone called 
testosterone. 
Functions of testosterone
 •
It influences the process of spermatogenesis.
 •
It stimulates protein synthesis and controls 
muscular growth.
 •
It is responsible for the development of 
secondary sexual characters (distribution 
of hair on body and face, deep voice 
pattern, etc).
Ovary
The ovaries are the female gonads located 
in the pelvic cavity of the abdomen. They secrete 
the female sex hormones
a. Estrogen 
b. Progesterone 
Estrogen is produced by the Graafian 
follicles of the ovary and progesterone from 
the corpus luteum that is formed in the ovary 
from the ruptured follicle during ovulation. 
Functions of estrogens
 •
It brings about the changes that occur 
during puberty. 
 •
It initiates the process of oogenesis.
 •
It stimulates the maturation of ovarian 
follicles in the ovary. 
 •
It promotes the development of secondary 
sexual characters (breast development, 
high pitched voice etc). 
Functions of progesterone
 •
It is responsible for the premenstrual 
changes of the uterus.
 •
It prepares the uterus for the implantation 
of the embryo.
 •
It maintains pregnancy.
 •
It is essential for the formation of placenta. 
16.2.7 Thymus Gland
Thymus is partly an endocrine gland and 
partly a lymphoid gland. It is located in the 
upper part of the chest covering the lower end 
of trachea. Thymosin is the hormone secreted 
by thymus.
