      INTRODUCTION
In general, whenever we think of computers, 
the things that come to our mind is computer 
screen, keyboard , mouse and CPU. We learnt 
about computer and parts of a computer as 
introductory part in standard VI. Apart from 
that, software and hardware also plays vital role 
in the working of computer. Now, shall we learn 
how to operate the computer?
The reason we prefer computer is its speed 
and the ability to store data. How can we save 
data and information in computer? We can save 
them in folders which accommodate multiple 
files or a single file. Let us understand the 
terminologies like file and folder before moving 
further.

23.1.1   FOLDER
A folder is a storage 
space that contains multiple 
files. We can create files as 
per the user’s need. For 
clear understanding, we can take the example 
of a bookshelf in a library. The individual book 
can be considered as a ‘file’ and the whole set 
of books in a shelf can be considered as folders. 
When we right click on the mouse, the popup 
menu appears on the screen with multiple 
options. Select ‘NEW’ option and a secondary 
menu comes up with another set of options. 
Select ‘Folder’ option in the menu. You can now 
save your file(s) in the newly created folder.
More people are using Windows and 
LINUX operating systems in their computers. 
We can do many activities like collect notes, 
draw/paint, create animations /spreadsheets/ 
word docs/PPTs etc.
We use ‘Guide Board’ to go to the unknown 
places like that when we ‘On’ the computer click 
the ‘START’ button at the left corner of the 
computer, it shows the list of all programs in the 
computer. Now select the required program and 
create the required files. 
How can we create Files?
For example if the computer is operating 
on the Windows OS, we can collect our notes 
in ‘Notepad’ application and draw pictures in 
‘Paint’ application.
As per it’s name we can type notes in 
‘Notepad’ and save the created files in a folder. 
Likewise in the ‘Paint’ app we can draw and edit 
pictures. With these pictures, let us see how 
we can create image gallery, animations and 
graphics easily.

was developed in the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology (MIT) Media Lab to make 
programming easier and more fun to learn.
Scratch Environment Editor
The Scratch editor has three main parts: 
They are Stage, Sprite and Script editor.
Stage: Stage is the background appearing when 
we open the scratch window. The background 
will most often be white. You can change the 
background colour as you like.
Sprite: The characters on the background of a 
Scratch window are known as Sprite. Usually 
acat appears as a sprite when the Scratch window 
is opened. The software provides facilities to 
make alternations in sprite.
Script editor / costume editor: Where you edit 
your programs or your sprite’s pictures.
You should see a single window with at least 
the following three panes: the Stage (top left), 
the Sprite List (bottom left), and the Scripts tab 
(right), which contains the Blocks tab and the 
Scripts Area. The right pane also contains two 
additional tabs, Costumes and Sounds. 
The script editor has three main parts:
• 
Script area: Where you build scripts.
• 
Block menu: Where you choose the category 
of blocks (programming statements) to use.
• 
Block palette: Where you choose the block 
to use.
When the Costumes tab is chosen, the costume 
editor is shown (outlined in red):
Movement and Loops
Click File/New to create a new project and enter 
a project name .
Click the menu Script → Event, drag a 
when green flag clicked block to the scripts 
area. Your scripts area should look like this:
 
Click the menu Script → Motion menu, 
drag a goto x: 0 y: 0 block to the scripts area and 
snap it to the bottom of the when green flag 
clicked block. Your script should look like this:
Add a move 10 steps block to the bottom 
of your script and change the 10 into 100.
Click the green flag at the top right corner 
of the stage to run your program.
