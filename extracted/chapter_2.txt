     INTRODUCTION 
Light is a form of energy which travels in 
the form of waves. The path of light is called 
ray of light and group of these rays are called 
as beam of light. Any object which gives out 
light are termed as source of light. Some of the 
sources emit their own light and they are called 
as luminous objects.  All the stars, including 
the Sun, are examples for luminous objects. 
We all know that we are able to see objects with 
the help of our eyes. But, we cannot see any 
object in a dark room. Can you explain why? 
If your answer is ‘we need light to see objects’, 
the next question is ‘if you make the light from 
a torch to fall on your eyes, will you be able to 
see the objects?’ Definitely, ‘NO’. We can see 
the objects only when the light is made to fall 
on the objects and the light reflected from the 
objects is viewed by our eyes. You would have 
studied about the reflection and refraction of 
light elaborately in your previous classes. In this 
chapter, we shall discuss about the scattering 
of light, images formed by convex and concave 
lenses, human eye and optical instruments 
such as telescopes and microscopes.
 2.1  PROPERTIES OF LIGHT
Let us recall the properties of light and the 
important aspects on refraction of light. 
1. Light is a form of energy.  
2. Light always travels along a straight line. 
3. Light does not need any medium for its 
propagation. It can even travel through 
vacuum. 
4. The speed of light in vacuum or air is, 
c = 3 × 108 ms–1.
5. Since, light is in the form of waves, it is 
characterized by a wavelength (λ) and 
a frequency (ν), which are related by the 
following equation: c = ν λ (c - velocity of 
light).

6. Different coloured light has different 
wavelength and frequency.
7. Among the visible light, violet light has the 
lowest wavelength and red light has the 
highest wavelength.
8. When light is incident on the interface 
between two media, it is partly reflected 
and partly refracted.
 2.2  REFRACTION OF LIGHT
When a ray of light travels from one 
transparent medium into another obliquely, 
the path of the  light undergoes deviation. This 
deviation of ray of light is called refraction. 
Refraction takes place due to the difference 
in the velocity of light in different media. The 
velocity of light is more in a rarer medium and 
less in a denser medium. Refraction of light 
obeys two laws of refraction.
2.2.1 First law of refraction:
The incident ray, the refracted ray of light 
and the normal to the refracting surface all lie 
in the same plane.
2.2.2 Second law of refraction:
The ratio of the sine of the angle of 
incidence and sine of the angle of refraction 
is equal to the ratio of refractive indices of the 
two media. This law is also known as Snell’s law.

 Refractive index gives us an idea of how fast 
or how slow light travels in a medium. The 
ratio of speed of light in vacuum (c) to the 
speed of light in a medium (v) is defined as 
refractive index ‘m’ of that medium.
m = c
v
 
 The speed of light in a medium is low if the 
refractive index of the medium is high and 
vice versa.
 
 When light travels from a denser medium 
into a rarer medium, the refracted ray is 
bent away from the normal drawn to the 
interface.
 
 When light travels from a rarer medium 
into a denser medium, the refracted ray 
is bent towards the normal drawn to the 
interface.
 2.3   REFRACTION OF A 
COMPOSITE LIGHT-
DISPERSION OF LIGHT
We know that Sun is the fundamental 
and natural source of light. If a source of light 
produces a light of single colour, it is known as 
a monochromatic source. On the other hand, 
a composite source of light produces a white 
light which contains light of different colours. 
Sun light is a composite light which consists 
of light of various colours or wavelengths. 
Another example for a composite source is a 
mercury vapour lamp. What do you observe 
when a white light is refracted through a glass 
prism? 
When a beam of white light or composite 
light is refracted through any transparent 
media such as glass or water, it is split into 
its component colours. This phenomenon is 
called as ‘dispersion of light’.
The band of colours is termed as spectrum. 
This spectrum consists of following colours: 
Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, 
and Red. These colours are represented by 
the acronym “VIBGYOR”. Why do we get 
the spectrum when white light is refracted 
by a transparent medium? This is because, 
different coloured lights are bent through 
different angles. That is the angle of refraction 
is different for different colours. 
Angle of refraction is the smallest for 
red and the highest for violet. From Snell’s 
law, we know that the angle of refraction is 
determined in terms of the refractive index 
of the medium. Hence, the refractive index of 
the medium is different for different coloured 
lights. This indicates that the refractive index 
of a medium is dependent on the wavelength 
of the light.

 2.4  SCATTERING OF LIGHT
When 
sunlight 
enters 
the 
Earth’s 
atmosphere, the atoms and molecules of 
different gases present in the atmosphere 
refract the light in all possible directions. 
This is called as ‘Scattering of light’.  In this 
phenomenon, the beam of light is redirected in 
all directions when it interacts with a particle 
of medium. The interacting particle of the 
medium is called as ‘scatterer’.
Figure 2.1 Scattering of light
 
2.4.1 Types of scattering
When a beam of light, interacts with 
a constituent particle of the medium, it 
undergoes many kinds of scattering. Based 
on initial and final energy of the light beam, 
scattering can be classified as, 
1) Elastic scattering 2) Inelastic scattering
1) Elastic scattering
If the energy of the incident beam of light 
and the scattered beam of light are same, then 
it is called as ‘elastic scattering’.
2) Inelastic scattering
If the energy of the incident beam of 
light and the scattered beam of light are not 
same, then it is called as ‘inelastic scattering’.
The nature and size of the scatterer results in 
different types of scattering. They are
• Rayleigh scattering
• Mie scattering
• Tyndall scattering
• Raman scattering
Rayleigh scattering
The scattering of sunlight by the atoms 
or molecules of the gases in the earth’s 
atmosphere is known as Rayleigh scattering.
 Rayleigh’s scattering law
Rayleigh’s scattering law states that, “The 
amount of scattering of light is inversely 
proportional to the fourth power of its 
wavelength”. 
Amount of scattering ‘S’  ∝    1  
 λ4
According to this law, the shorter 
wavelength colours are scattered much more 
than the longer wavelength colours.
When sunlight passes through the 
atmosphere, 
the 
blue 
colour 
(shorter 
wavelength) is scattered to a greater extent 
than the red colour (longer wavelength). This 
scattering causes the sky to appear in blue 
colour.
At sunrise and sunset, the light rays from 
the Sun have to travel a larger distance in the 
atmosphere than at noon. Hence, most of the 
blue lights are scattered away and only the 
red light which gets least scattered reaches 
us. Therefore, the colour of the Sun is red at 
sunrise and sunset.
 Mie scattering
Mie scattering takes place when the 
diameter of the scatterer is similar to or larger 
than the wavelength of the incident light. It 
is also an elastic scattering. The amount of 
scattering is independent of wave length.
Mie scattering is caused by pollen, dust, 
smoke, water droplets, and other particles in 
the lower portion of the atmosphere.
Mie scattering is responsible for the 
white appearance of the clouds. When white 
light falls on the water drop, all the colours 
are equally scattered which together form the 
white light.

Optics
Tyndall Scattering
When a beam of sunlight, enters into a 
dusty room through a window, then its path 
becomes visible to us. This is because, the tiny 
dust particles present in the air of the room 
scatter the beam of light. This is an example of 
Tyndall Scattering 
The scattering of light rays by the 
colloidal particles in the colloidal solution is 
called Tyndall Scattering or Tyndall Effect.
Do you Know
Colloid is a microscopically small substance 
that is equally dispersed throughout another 
material. Example: Milk, Ice cream, muddy 
water, smoke
 Raman scattering
When a parallel beam of monochromatic 
(single coloured ) light passes through a gas or 
liquid or transparent solid, a part of light  rays 
are  scattered.
The scattered light contains some additional 
frequencies (or wavelengths) other than that 
of incident frequency (or wavelength). This is 
known as Raman scattering or Raman Effect. 
Raman Scattering is defined as “The 
interaction of light ray with the particles of pure 
liquids or transparent solids, which leads to a 
change in wavelength or frequency.”
The spectral lines having frequency 
equal to the incident ray frequency is called 
‘Rayleigh line’ and the spectral lines which are 
having frequencies other than the incident ray 
frequency are called ‘Raman lines’. The lines 
having frequencies lower than the incident 
frequency is called stokes lines and the lines 
having frequencies higher than the incident 
frequency are called Antistokes lines. 
You will study more about Raman Effect 
in higher classes.
 2.5  LENSES
A lens is an optically transparent medium 
bounded by two spherical refracting surfaces 
or one plane and one spherical surface.
Lens is basically classified into two types. 
They are: (i) Convex Lens (ii) Concave Lens
(i) Convex or bi-convex lens: It is a lens 
bounded by two spherical surfaces such 
that it is thicker at the centre than at the 
edges. A beam of light passing through it, 
is converged to a point. So, a convex lens is 
also called as converging lens. 
(ii) Concave or bi-concave Lens: It is a lens 
bounded by two spherical surfaces such 
that it is thinner at the centre than at the 
edges. A parallel beam of light passing 
through it, is diverged or spread out. So, a 
concave lens is also called as diverging lens.
2.5.1 Other types of Lenses
Plano-convex lens: If one of the faces of a 
bi-convex lens is plane, it is known as a plano-
convex lens. 
Plano-concave lens: If one of the faces 
of a bi-concave lens is plane, it is known as a 
plano-concave lens. 
All these lenses are shown in Figure 2.2 
given below:

 2.6   IMAGES FORMED DUE TO 
REFRACTION THROUGH 
A CONVEX AND CONCAVE 
LENS
When an object is placed in front of a 
lens, the light rays from the object fall on the 
lens. The position, size and nature of the image 
formed can be understood only if we know 
certain basic rules.
Rule-1: When a ray of light strikes the 
convex or concave lens obliquely at its optical 
centre, it continues to follow its path without 
any deviation (Figure 2.3).
Figure 2.3 Rays passing through the  
optical centre
Rule-2: When rays parallel to the principal axis 
strikes a convex or concave lens, the refracted 
rays are converged to (convex lens) or appear 
to diverge from (concave lens) the principal 
focus (Figure 2.4).
Figure 2.4 Rays passing parallel to the optic 
axis
Rule-3: When a ray passing through (convex 
lens) or directed towards (concave lens) the 
principal focus strikes a convex or concave 
lens, the refracted ray will be parallel to the 
principal axis (Figure 2.5).

towards the principal focus
 2.7   REFRACTION THROUGH A 
CONVEX LENS
Let 
us 
discuss 
the 
formation of images by a 
convex lens when the object 
is placed at various positions.
Object at infinity

image is formed at the principal focus. The size 
of the image is much smaller than that of the 
object (Figure 2.6).

CONCAVE LENS
Let us discuss the formation of images by 
a concave lens when the object is placed at two 
possible positions.

virtual image is formed at the focus. The size of 
the image is much smaller than that of the object 
(Figure 2.12).

Object anywhere on the principal 
axis at a finite distance
When an object is placed at a finite distance 
from the lens, a virtual image is formed between

object (Figure 2.13).

But, as the distance between the object 
and the lens is decreased, the distance 
between the image and the lens also keeps 
decreasing. Further, the size of the image 
formed increases as the distance between the 
object and the lens is decreased. This is shown 
in (figure 2.14).

2. They are used in wide angle spy hole in 
doors.
3. They are used to correct the defect of vision 
called ‘myopia’
 2.11  LENS FORMULA
Like spherical mirrors, we have lens 
formula for spherical lenses. The lens 
formula gives the relationship among 
distance of the object (u), distance of the 
image (v) and the focal length (f) of the 
lens. It is expressed as
 
 1 
 f
 =  1 
 v
 −  1 
 u
 . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.2
It is applicable to both convex and 
concave lenses. We need to give an at most 
care while solving numerical problems 
related to lenses in taking proper signs of 
different quantities.
2.12  SIGN CONVENTION
Cartesian sign conventions are used for 
measuring the various distances in the ray 
diagrams of spherical lenses. According to 
cartesian sign convention,
1. The object is always placed on the left side 
of the lens.
2. All the distances are measured from the 
optical centre of the lens.
3. The distances measured in the same 
direction as that of incident light are taken 
as positive.
4. The distances measured against the direction 
of incident light are taken as negative.
5. The distances measured upward and 
perpendicular to the principal axis is taken 
as positive.
6. The distances measured downward and 
perpendicular to the principal axis is taken 
as negative.
2.13   MAGNIFICATION OF A 
LENS
Like 
spherical 
mirrors, 
we 
have 
magnification for spherical lenses. Spherical 
lenses produce magnification and it is defined 
as the ratio of the height of the image to the 
10th_Science_Unit-2.indd   22
12/2/2022   4:59:16 PM


23
Optics
height of an object. Magnification is denoted 
by the letter ‘m’. If height of the object is h and 
height of the image is h´, the magnification 
produced by lens is,
m =  height of the image 
 height of the object 
 =  h'
 h 
    …… (2.3)
Also it is related to the distance of the object 
(u) and the distance of the image (v) as follows:
m =  Distance of the image 
 Distance of the object 
 =  v 
 u 
  …… (2.4)
If the magnification is greater than 1, then 
we get an enlarged image. On the other hand, 
if the magnification is less than 1, then we get a 
diminished image. 
 2.14   LENS MAKER’S 
FORMULA
All lenses are made up of transparent 
materials. Any optically transparent material 
will have a refractive index. The lens formula 
relates the focal length of a lens with the distance 
of object and image. For a maker of any lens, 
knowledge of radii of curvature of the lens is 
required. This clearly indicates the need for an 
equation relating the radii of curvature of the 
lens, the refractive index of the given material of 
the lens and the required focal length of the lens. 
The lens maker’s formula is one such equation. 
It is given as
 1 
 f  = (µ − 1)    1  
 R1
 −   1  
 R2  
 . . . . . . . . .(2.5)
where µ is the refractive index of the 
material of the lens; R1 and R2 are the radii of 
curvature of the two faces of the lens; f is the 
focal length of the lens.
 2.15  POWER OF A LENS
When a ray of light falls on a lens, the 
ability to converge or diverge these light rays 
depends on the focal length of the lens. This 
ability of a lens to converge (convex lens) or 
diverge (concave lens) is called as its power. 
Hence, the power of a lens can be defined as the 
degree of convergence or divergence of light 
rays. Power of a lens is numerically defined as 
the reciprocal of its focal length.
P =  1 
 f
 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .(2.6)
The SI unit of power of a lens is dioptre. It 
is represented by the symbol D. If focal length 
is expressed in ‘m’, then the power of lens is 
expressed in ‘D’. Thus 1D is the power of a lens, 
whose focal length is 1metre. 1D = 1m-1.
By convention, the power of a convex lens 
is taken as positive whereas the power of a 
concave lens is taken, as negative. 
More to Know
The lens formula  and lens maker’s formula 
are applicable to only thin lenses. In the case 
of thick lenses, these formulae with little 
modifications are used.

 2.16  HUMAN EYE
The human eyes are most valuable and 
sensitive organs responsible for vision. They are 
the gateway to the wonderful world. 
Structure of the eye
The eye ball is approximately spherical 
in shape with a diameter of about 2.3 cm. It 
consists of a tough membrane called sclera, 
which protects the internal parts of the eye.
Important parts of human eye are
Cornea: This is the thin and transparent layer 
on the front surface of the eyeball as shown in 
figure 2.15. It is the main refracting surface. 
When light enters through the cornea, it 
refracts or bends the light on to the lens.
Iris: It is the coloured part of the eye. It may be 
blue, brown or green in colour. Every person 
has a unique colour, pattern and texture. Iris 
controls amount of light entering into the 
pupil like camera aperture.
Pupil: It is the centre part of the Iris. It is the 
pathway for the light to retina.
Retina: This is the back surface of the eye. It is 
the most sensitive part of human eye, on which 
real and inverted image of objects is formed. 
Eye Lens – It is the important part of human 
eye. It is convex in nature.
Ciliary muscles – Eye lens is fixed between 
the ciliary muscles. It helps to change the focal 
length of the eye lens according to the position 
of the object.

Figure 2.15 Human eye
Working of the eye
The transparent layer cornea bends the 
light rays through pupil located at the centre 
part of the Iris. The adjusted light passes 
through the eye lens. Eye lens is convex in 
nature. So, the light rays from the objects 
are converged and a real and inverted image 
is formed on retina.  Then, retina passes the 
received real and inverted image to the brain 
through optical nerves. Finally, the brain 
senses it as erect image.
Power of Accommodation
The ability of the eye lens to focus nearby 
as well as the distant objects is called power of 
accommodation of the eye. This is achieved by 
changing the focal length of the eye lens with 
the help of ciliary muscles. 
Eye lens is made of a flexible, jelly-like 
material. By relaxing and contracting the ciliary 
muscle, the curvature and hence the focal 
length of the eye lens can be altered. When we 
see distant objects, the ciliary muscle relaxes 
and makes the eye lens thinner. This increases 
the focal length of the eye lens. Hence, the 
distant object can be clearly seen. On the other 
hand, when we look at a closer object, the 
focal length of the eye lens is decreased by the 
contraction of ciliary muscle. Thus, the image 
of the closer object is clearly formed on the 
retina. 
Persistence of vision
If 
the 
time 
interval 
between 
two 
consecutive light pulses is less than 1
16 second, 
human eye cannot distinguish them separately. 
It is called persistence of vision.
The far point and near point of 
the human eye
The minimum distance required to see the 
objects distinctly without strain is called least 
distance of distinct vision. It is called as near 
point of eye. It is 25 cm for normal human eye.

Optics
The maximum distance up to which the 
eye can see objects clearly is called as far point 
of the eye. It is infinity for normal eye.
 2.17  DEFECTS IN EYE
A normal human eye can clearly see all 
the objects placed between 25cm and infinity. 
But, for some people, the eye loses its power 
of accommodation. This could happen due to 
many reasons including ageing. Hence, their 
vision becomes defective. Let us discuss some 
of the common defects of human eye. 
Myopia
Myopia, also known as short sightedness, 
occurs due to the lengthening of eye ball. With 
this defect, nearby objects can be seen clearly 
but distant objects cannot be seen clearly. The 
focal length of eye lens is reduced or the distance 
between eye lens and retina increases. Hence, 
the far point will not be infinity for such eyes 
and the far point has come closer. Due to this, 
the image of distant objects are formed before 
the retina (Figure 2.16-a). This defect can be 
corrected using a concave lens (Figure 2.16-b). 
The focal length of the concave lens to be used 
is computed as follows: 
Figure 2.16  (a) Vision with myopia 
b) Corrected vision using a concave lens
(a) Myopia
(b) Myopia corrected eye
Let a person with myopia eye can see up 
to a distance x. Suppose that he wants to see 
all objects farther than this distance, i.e., up to 
infinity. Then the focal length of the required 
concave lens is f = –x. If the person can see 
up to a distance x and if he wishes to see up 
to a distance y, then, the focal length of the 
required concave lens is,
f =    xy   
 x−y  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .(2.7)
Hypermeteropia
Hypermeteropia, also known as long 
sightedness, occurs due to the shortening of 
eye ball. With this defect, distant objects can 
be seen clearly but nearby objects cannot be 
seen clearly. The focal length of eye lens is 
increased or the distance between eye lens 
and retina decreases. Hence, the near point 
will not be at 25cm for such eyes and the 
near point has moved farther. Due to this, the 
image of nearby objects are formed behind 
the retina (Figure 2.17-a). This defect can be 
corrected using a convex lens (Figure 2.17-b). 
The focal length of the convex lens to be used 
is computed as follows: 
Figure 2.17  (a) Vision with hypermeteropia  
(b) Corrected vision using a convex lens
Let a person with hypermeteropia eye can 
see object beyond a distance d. Suppose that he 
wants to see all objects closer than this distance 
up to a distance D. Then, the focal length of the 
required convex lens is
f =    dD   
 d−D 
 . . . . . . . . . . . . . .(2.8)
Presbyopia
Due to ageing, ciliary muscles become 
weak and the eye-lens become rigid (inflexible) 
andso the eye loses its power of accommodation.
Because of this, an aged person cannot see 
the nearby objects clearly. So, it is also called as 
‘old age hypermetropia’.

Some persons may have both the defects 
of vision - myopia as well as hypermetropia. 
This can be corrected by ‘bifocal lenses’. In 
which, upper part consists of concave lens (to 
correct myopia) used for distant vision and the 
lower part consists of convex lens (to correct 
hypermetropia) used for reading purposes.
Astigmatism
In this defect, eye cannot see parallel and 
horizontal lines clearly. It may be inherited or 
acquired. It is due to the imperfect structure of 
eye lens because of the development of cataract 
on the lens, ulceration of cornea, injury to the 
refracting surfaces, etc. Astigmatism can be 
corrected by using cylindrical lenses.
 2.18  MICROSCOPE
This is an optical instrument, which helps 
us to see tiny (very small) objects. It is classified 
as 
1. Simple microscope
2. Compound microscope
Simple Microscope
Simple microscope has a convex lens of 
short focal length. It is held near the eye to get 
enlarged image of small objects.
Let an object (AB) is placed at a point 
within the principal focus (u < f) of the convex 
lens and the observer’s eye is placed just behind 
the lens. As per this position the convex lens 
produces an erect, virtual and enlarged image 
(A'B'). The image formed is in the same side of 
the object and the distance equal to the least 
distance of distinct vision (D) (For normal 
human eye D = 25 cm).
Uses of Simple microscope
Simple microscopes are used 
a) by watch repairers and jewellers.
b) to read small letters clearly.
c) to observe parts of flower, insects etc.
d) to observe finger prints in the field of 
forensic science.
Compound microscope
Compound microscope is also used to 
see the tiny objects. It has better magnification 
power than simple microscope.
Magnification power of microscopes 
can be increased by decreasing the focal 
length of the lens used. Due to constructional 
limitations, the focal length of the lens cannot 
be decreased beyond certain limit. This 
problem can be solved by using two separate 
biconvex lenses. 
Construction
A compound microscope consists of two 
convex lenses. The lens with the shorter focal 
length is placed near the object, and is called 
as ‘objective lens’ or ‘objective piece’. The lens 
with larger focal length and larger aperture 
placed near the observer’s eye is called as ‘eye 
lens’ or ‘eye piece’.  Both the lenses are fixed in 
a narrow tube with adjustable provision.
Working
The object (AB) is placed  at a distance 
slightly greater than the focal length of 
objective lens (u > fo). A real, inverted and 
magnified image (A'B') is formed at the other

side of the objective lens. This image behaves 
as the object for the eye lens. The position of 
the eye lens is adjusted in such a way, that the 
image (A'B') falls within the principal focus of 
the eye piece.  This eye piece forms a virtual, 
enlarged and erect image (A" B") on the same 
side of the object
Compound microscope has 50 to 200 
times more magnification power than simple 
microscope
Travelling Microscope
A travelling microscope is one of the best 
instrument for measuring very small length 
with high degree of accuracy at the order of 
0.01mm.  It works based on the principle of 
vernier. Its least count is 0.01 mm.
 2.19  TELESCOPE
Have you seen the recent lunar eclipse? 
With our naked eye we can’t visualize the 
phenomena distinctly. Then, how can we see 
the distant object in clearer manner? It is 
possible with telescope.
Telescope is an optical instrument to see 
the distant objects. The first telescope was 
invented by Johann Lippershey in 1608. Galileo 
made a telescope to observe distant stars. He 
got the idea, from a spectacle maker who one 
day observed that the distant weather cock 
appeared magnified through his lens system 
fitted in his shop. Galileo observed the satellites 
of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn through 
his telescope. Kepler invented Telescope in 
1611 which was fundamentally similar to the 
astronomical telescope. 
Types of Telescope
According to optical property, it is 
classified into two groups: 
i) refracting telescope ii) reflecting telescope
In refracting telescope lenses are used. 
Galilean 
telescope, 
Keplerian 
telescope, 
Achromatic refractors, are some refracting 
telescopes.
In reflecting telescope parabolic mirrors 
are used Gregorian, Newtonian, Cassegrain 
telescope are some Reflecting telescopes
According to the things which are 
observed, 
Astronomical 
Telescope 
and 
Terrestrial Telescopes are the two major types 
of telescope.
Astronomical Telescope
An astronomical telescope is used to view 
heavenly bodies like stars, planets galaxies and 
satellites.
Terrestrial Telescopes
The image in an astronomical telescope 
is inverted. So, it is not suitable for viewing 
objects on the surface of the Earth. Therefore, 
a terrestrial telescope is used. It provides an 
erect image. The major difference between 
astronomical and terrestrial telescope is 
erecting the final image with respect to the 
object.
Advantages of Telescopes
• 
Elaborate view of the Galaxies, Planets, stars 
and other heavenly bodies is possible.
• 
Camera can be attached for taking 
photograph for the celestial objects.
• 
Telescope can be viewed even with the low 
intensity of light.
Disadvantages
• 
Frequent maintenances needed.
• 
It is not easily portable one.

 Light is a form of energy which travels 
along a straight line 
 

The deviation in the path of light ray is 
called refraction.
 

The ratio of speed of light in vacuum to 
the speed of light in a medium is defined 
as refractive index ‘µ’ of that medium.

Problem-3
A person with myopia can see objects placed at 
a distance of 4m. If he wants to see objects at a 
distance of 20m, what should be the focal length 
and power of the concave lens he must wear?
Solution:
Given that x = 4m and y = 20m.
Focal length of the correction lens is 
        f =    xy   
 x−y    (Refer eqn.2.7)
       f =  4 × 20

Problem-4
For a person with hypermeteropia, the 
near point has moved to 1.5m. Calculate the 
focal length of the correction lens in order to 
make his eyes normal.
Solution:
Given that, d = 1.5m; D = 25cm = 0.25m (For 
a normal eye).
From equation (2.8), the focal length of the 
correction lens is 
f =  d × D 
 d − D  =  1.5 × 0.25 
1.5 − 0.25  =  0.375
