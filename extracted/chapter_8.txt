        INTRODUCTION
The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 
witnessed a rapid development in chemistry 
in all spheres of scientific activities. By 1860, 
scientists had already discovered 60 elements 
and determined their atomic masses. They 
noticed that some elements had similar 
properties and hence arranged them into 
groups. During this period, several new 
elements were discovered. These elements 
were found to have different properties. It was 
realized that instead of studying the properties 
of all these elements individually, it would be 
more convenient to divide them into groups and 
periods in such a way that each group contained 
a certain number of elements (like an array of 
fruits and vegetables showing orderliness)
with similar properties and periods showing a 
regular gradation. So, scientists made several 
attempts to arrange elements in a logical way. 
You have studied about all these early attempts 
of arrangement of elements in standard IX. In 
continuation of the knowledge gained in the 
topic periodic classification of elements in 
standard IX with earlier concepts and their 
subsequent deliberations, you get set to go 
ahead with the higher order of thinking to 
enhance your knowledge on the properties of 
elements.

Periodic Classificaiton of Elements
 8.1  MODERN PERIODIC LAW
Mendeleev’s periodic table had some 
discrepancies, which were difficult to overcome. 
For example, the atomic mass of argon (39.95 
amu) is greater than that of potassium (39.10 
amu), but argon comes before potassium in 
the periodic table. If elements were arranged 
solely according to increasing atomic mass, 
argon would appear in the position occupied 
by potassium in our modern periodic table (see 
in Figure 8.1). No chemist would place argon, a 
gas with no tendency to react, in the same group 
as lithium and sodium,which are two highly 
reactive metals. This kind of discrepancies 
suggested that some fundamental property 
other than atomic mass must be the basis of 
periodicity. The fundamental property turned 
out to be the number of protons in an atom’s 
nucleus, something that could not have been 
known by Mendeleev and his contemporaries.
Henry Moseley, a British scientist in 1912, 
discovered a new property of elements called 
atomic number, which provided a better basis 
for the periodic arrangement of the elements. 
It is a well-known fact that atomic number of 
an element is equal to the number of protons 
or the number of electrons present in the 
neutral atom of an element. The periodic law 
was, therefore, modified to frame a modern 
periodic law, which states that
“The physical and chemical properties 
of the elements are the periodic functions of 
their atomic numbers”.
 8.2  MODERN PERIODIC TABLE
With reference to the modern periodic law, 
the elements were arranged in the increasing 
order of their atomic numbers to form the 
modern periodic table. The modern periodic 
table is a tabular arrangement of elements in 
periods and groups, highlighting the regular 
repetition of properties of the elements. 
Figure 8.1 shows the modern periodic table of 
118 elements discovered so far. 
As you have studied the features of the 
modern periodic table in standard IX, here 
let us confine to the study of the features of 
periods and groups.
8.2.1 Features of Periods
 
 The horizontal rows are called periods. 
There are seven periods in the periodic 
table.
 
 First period (Atomic number 1 and 2): 
This is the shortest period. It contains 
only two elements (Hydrogen and 
Helium).
 
 Second period (Atomic number 3 to 10): 
This is a short period. It contains eight 
elements (Lithium to Neon).
 
 Third period (Atomic number 11 to 18): 
This is also a short period. It contains 
eight elements (Sodium to Argon).
 
 Fourth period (Atomic number 19 to 36): 
This is a long period. It contains eighteen 
elements (Potassium to Krypton). This 
includes 8 representative elements and 10 
transition elements.
 
 Fifth period (Atomic number 37 to 54): 
This is also a long period. It contains 
18 elements (Rubidium to Xenon). This 
includes 8 representative elements and 10 
transition elements.
 
 Sixth period (Atomic number 55 to 86): 
This is the longest period. It contains 
32 elements (Caesium to Radon). This 
includes 8 representative elements, 
10 transition elements and 14 inner 
transition elements (Lanthanides).
 
 Seventh period (Atomic number 87 
to 118): Like the sixth period, this 
period also accommodates 32 elements. 
Recently 4 elements have been included 
by IUPAC.

Periodic Classificaiton of Elements
8.2.2 Features of Groups
 
 The vertical columns in the periodic table 
starting from top to bottom are called 
groups. There are 18 groups in the periodic 
table.
 
 Based on the common characteristics 
of elements in each group, they can be 
grouped as various families.
Group Number
Family
1
Alkali Metals
2
Alkaline earth metals
3 to 12
Transition metals
13
Boron Family
14
Carbon Family
15
Nitrogen Family
16
Oxygen Family (or) 
Chalcogen family
17
Halogens
18
Noble gases
 
 The Lanthanides and Actinides, which 
form part of Group 3 are called inner 
transition elements.
 
 Except 'group 18', all the elements present 
in each group have the same number of 
electrons in their valence shell and thus 
have the same valency. For example, all 
the elements of group 1 have one electron 
in their valence shells (1s1). So, the 
valency of all the alkali metals is ‘1’. 
 
 As the elements present in a group 
have identical valence shell electronic 
configurations, they possess similar 
chemical properties.
 
 The physical properties of the elements 
in a group such as melting point, boiling 
point and density vary gradually.
 
 The atoms of the 'group 18' elements have 
stable electronic configuration in their 
valence shells and hence they are unreactive.
 8.3   PERIODIC TRENDS IN 
PROPERTIES
The 
electronic 
conﬁgurations of elements 
help us to explain the periodic 
recurrence 
of 
physical 
and 
chemical 
properties. 
Anything 
which 
repeats 
itself after a regular interval 
is called periodic and this behaviour is called 
periodicity. Some of the atomic properties of 
the elements are periodic. 
Properties such as atomic radius, ionic 
radius, ionisation energy, electronegativity, 
electron affinity, show a regular periodicity 
and hence they are called periodic properties. 
The main significance of the modern periodic 
table is that it gives a clear understanding of the 
general properties and trends within a group or 
a period to predict with considerable accuracy, 
the properties of any element, even though that 
element may be unfamiliar to us. Let us discuss 
the periodic trend of some of the properties.
8.3.1 Atomic Radius
Atomic radius of an atom is defined as 
the distance between the centre of its nucleus 
and the outermost shell containing the valence 
electron. Direct measurement of the radius of 
an isolated atom is not possible. Except for 
noble gases, usually the atomic radius is 
referred to as covalent radius or metallic 
radius depending on 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
bonding between the 
concerned 
atoms. 
Atomic radius in metal 
atoms 
is 
known 
as 
metallic radius. It is 
defined as half the 
distance between the 
nuclei 
of 
adjacent 
metal atoms (Figure 8.2

(a)). In non-metallic elements, their atomic 
radius is known as Covalent radius. It is 
defined as half the distance between the 
adjacent nuclei of two covalently bonded 
atoms of the same element in a molecule 
(Figure 8.2 (b)). For example, let us consider 
H2 molecule. The distance between the two 
hydrogen nuclei of the molecule is 0.74 Å. So 
its covalent radius is 
0.74/2 = 0.37 Å. 
When 
you 
look 
at the variation of the 
atomic 
radii 
in 
the 
periodic 
table, 
there 
are two distinct trends. 
Along the period, from left to right, the atomic 
radius of the elements decreases whereas along 
the groups, from the top to bottom, the atomic 
radius increases. The increase, down a group, is 
due to the increase in the valence shell number 
down the group. As the shell number increases, 
the distance between the valence shell and 
the nucleus increases. In contrast, when you 
observe along the period, the shell number 
remains the same but the number of protons 
(i.e. atomic number) increases. More and more 
positive charges impose a strong attraction 
over the electrons and thus the electron cloud 
shrinks towards the nucleus, which results in 
the decrease in the atomic size. Figure 8.4 shows 
how the atomic radius decreases from lithium 
to boron. 
Figure 8.4 Variation of atomic radius
8.3.2 Ionic Radii
It is defined as the distance from the centre 
of the nucleus of the ion upto the point where 
it exerts its influence on the electron cloud of 
Figure 8.3  
Atomic radius

the ion. You know that ions are formed when 
an atom lose or gain electrons. When a neutral 
atom loses an electron, it becomes a positively 
charged ion called cation, whereas the gain of 
an electron by a neutral atom forms a negatively 
charged ion called anion. The size of the ions 
is important to determine their behaviours 
in solutions and the structure of ionic solids. 
The size of a cation is always smaller than its 
corresponding neutral atom. But, the anion is 
larger than its neutral atom.
Note:  As the positive charge increases the size 
of the cation decreases  
As the negative charge increases the 
size of the anion increases 
For instance, lithium and sodium lose the 
single electron from their outermost energy level 
to form cations. The ions so formed are smaller 
because the remaining electrons are at a inner 
cells and attracted more strongly by the nucleus. 
Fluorine and chlorine become negative ions by 
gaining an electron. When electrons are added, 
the charge on the nucleus is not great enough 
to hold the increased number of electrons as 
closely as it holds the electrons in the neutral 
atom. So, as seen in atomic radius, ionic radii 
also decrease along the period from left to 
right and increase down the group. 
8.3.3 Ionisation Energy
Ionisation energy is the minimum 
energy required to remove an electron from

Periodic Classificaiton of Elements
an isolated gaseous atom in its ground state to 
form a cation. It is otherwise called ionisation 
enthalpy. It is measured in kJ/mol. Higher 
the ionisation energy, it is more difficult to 
remove the electron. 
As the atomic size decreases from left 
to right in a period, more energy is required 
to remove the electrons. So, the ionisation 
energy increases along the period. But, down 
the group, the atomic size increases and hence 
the valence electrons are loosely bound. They 
require relatively less energy for the removal. 
Thus, ionisation energy decreases down the 
group in the periodic table. 
8.3.4 Electron Affinity
Electron affinity is the amount of energy 
released when an isolated gaseous atom 
gains an electron to form its anion. It is also 
measured in kJ/mol and represented by the 
following equation:
A(g) + e– → A–
(g) + Energy 
Cl(g) + e– → Cl–
(g) + energy
Like ionisation energy, electron affinity 
also increases from left to right in a period and 
decreases from top to bottom in a group. 
More to Know
Noble gases show no tendency to accept 
electrons because the outer s and p orbitals 
of noble gases are completely filled. No more 
electrons can be added to them and hence 
their electron affinities are zero.
8.3.5 Electronegativity 
Electronegativity of an element is the 
measure of the tendency of its atom to attract the 
shared pair of electrons towards itself in a covalent 
bond. Let us consider HCl molecule. Both the 
hydrogen and chlorine atoms share one electron 
each to form the  covalent bond between them. 
chlorine atom has a higher electronegativity 
and hence it pulls the shared electrons towards 
itself more strongly than hydrogen. Thus, when 
the bond breaks, the bonding electrons are left 
with chlorine forming H+ and Cl– ions. It is 
represented, diagrammatically, as shown below:
H
Cl
Elctron Transferred
Cl
H

–
Strong Pull
Figure 8.6 Relative electronegativity of  
H and Cl
Electronegativity is based on various 
experimental data such as bond energy, 
ionization potential, electron affinity, etc.
Pauling scale is the widely used scale to 
determine the electronegativity, which in 
turn predicts the nature of bonding (ionic or 
covalent) between the atoms in a molecule.
Electronegativity of some of the elements 
are given below 
F = 4.0, Cl = 3.0, Br = 2.8, I = 2.5, H = 2.1, Na = 1
If the difference in electronegativity 
between two elements is 1.7, the bond 
has 50% ionic character and 50% covalent 
character.
If the difference is less than 1.7, the bond 
is considered to be more covalent.
If the difference is greater than 1.7, the 
bond is considered to be more ionic.
Along the period, from left to right in the 
periodic table, the electronegativity increases 
because of the increase in the nuclear charge 
which in turn attracts the electrons more strongly. 
On moving down a group, the electronegativity 
of the elements decreases because of the 
increased number of valence shells.

 8.4  METALLURGY
Human life is associated with various 
metals. We use metals in our day to day 
activities. It is the utmost need to have some 
metals like sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, 
etc. in the human body. Deficiency of these 
metals affects the metabolic activities thereby 
causing diseases. So, metals 
play a vital role in our life. 
In this section, let us discuss 
how metals are obtained from 
various sources by the process 
of metallurgy. 
Metallurgy is a science of extracting 
metals from their ores and modifying the 
metals into alloys for various uses, based on 
their physical and chemical properties and 
their structural arrangement of atoms. A 
metallurgical process involve three main steps 
as follows:
(i) 
Concentration or Separation of the ore: 
It is the process of removal of impuries 
from the ore.
(ii) Production of the metal: It is the 
convertion of the ore into metal.
(iii) Refining of the metal: It is the process of 
purification of the metal.
8.4.1 Terminology in metallurgy
Minerals: A mineral may be a single 
compound or a complex mixture of various 
compounds of metals found in the Earth.
Ore: The mineral from which a metal can 
be readily and economically extracted on a 
large scale is said to be an ore. 
Conceptual
Thoughts
All ores are
minerals; But
all minerals
are not ores.
Why?
For example: Clay (Al2O3. 2 SiO2. 2 H2O) 
and bauxite (Al2O3.2 H2O) are the two minerals 
of aluminium, but aluminium can be profitably 
extracted only from bauxite. Hence, bauxite is 
an ore of aluminium and clay is its mineral.
Mining: The process of extracting the ores 
from the Earth's crust is called mining.
Gangue or Matrix: The rocky impurity 
associated with an ore is called gangue or matrix.
Flux: It is the substance added to the 
ore to reduce the fusion temperature and to 
remove the impurities. E.g. Calcium oxide 
(basic), Silica (acidic). If the gangue is acidic, 
then basic flux is added and vice versa.
Slag: It is the fusible product formed 
when a flux reacts with a gangue during the 
extraction of metals.
Flux + Gangue → Slag
Smelting: Smelting is the process of 
reducing the roasted metallic oxide from the 
metal in its molten condition. In this process, 
impurities are removed as slag by the addition 
of flux.
8.4.2  Types of separation or 
concentration of an ore
There are four major types of separation 
of ores based on the nature of the ore. The 
10th_Science_Unit-8.indd   112

Periodic Classificaiton of Elements
different kinds of ores of metals are given in 
Table 8.1
Concentration of the crushed ore is done 
mainly by the following methods: -
(i) 
Hydraulic (Gravity Separation)  
method
Principle: The difference in the densities 
or specific gravities of the ore and the gangue 
is the main principle behind this method. 
Oxide ores are purified by this method. e.g., 
Haematite Fe2O3 the ore of iron.
Note: When the ore is heavier than the 
impurity, this method can be used.
Method: The ore is poured over a sloping, 
vibrating corrugated table with grooves and a jet 
of water is allowed to flow over it. The denser ore 
particles settle down in the grooves and lighter 
gangue particles are washed down by water. 
(ii) Magnetic separation method
Principle: The magnetic properties of 
the ores form the basis of separation. When 
either the ore or the gangue is magnetic, this 
method is employed. e.g., Tinstone SnO2, the 
ore of tin.
Magnetic roller
Magnetic
particles
Finely ground ore
Non-Magnetic
particles
Figure 8.8 Magnetic separation
Method: The crushed ore is placed over 
a conveyer belt which rotates around two 
metal wheels, one of which is magnetic. The 
magnetic particles are attracted to the magnetic 
wheel and fall separately apart from the non-
magnetic particles. 
(iii) Froth floatation
Principle: This process depends on 
the preferential wettability of the ore with 
oil (pine oil) and the gangue particles by 
water. Lighter ores, such as sulphide ores, 
are concentrated by this method. e.g., Zinc 
blende (ZnS).

of sulphide ores.
Figure 8.9 Froth floatation
Note: When the impurity is heavier than 
the ore, this method can be used.
Method: The crushed ore is taken in a 
large tank containing pine oil and water and 
agitated with a current of compressed air.The 
ore is wetted by the oil and gets separated from 
the gangue in the form of froth. Since the ore 
is lighter, it comes on the surface with the froth 
and the  impurities are left behind. e.g., Zinc 
blende (ZnS).
(iv) Chemical method or Leaching
This method is employed when the ore is 
in a very pure form.

The ore is treated with a suitable reagent 
such that the ore is soluble in it but the 
impurities are not. The impurities are removed 
by filtration. The solution of the ore, ie., the 
filtrate is treated with a suitable reagent which 
precipitates the ore. E.g. Bauxite Al2O3.2H2O, 
(the ore of aluminium).

 8.7   METALLURGY OF 
ALUMINIUM
Aluminium is the metal found most 
abundantly in the Earth’s crust. Since it is a 
reactive metal, it occurs in the combined state. 
The important ores of aluminium are as follows
Ores of Aluminium 
Formula
Bauxite 
Al2O3.2H2O
Cryolite 
Na3AlF6
Corundum 
Al2O3
Bauxite is the chief ore of aluminium. The 
extraction of aluminium from bauxite involves 
two steps: 
(i) Conversion of bauxite into alumina – 
Baeyer’s Process
The conversion of Bauxite into Alumina 
involves the following steps:
Bauxite ore is finely ground and heated 
under pressure with a solution of concentrated 
caustic soda solution at 150° C to obtain sodium 
meta aluminate.
Al2O3 + 2 NaOH → 2 NaAlO2 + H2O
On diluting sodium meta aluminate with 
water, a precipitate of aluminium hydroxide is 
formed.
NaAlO2   + 2 H2O → Al (OH)3 + NaOH
The precipitate is filtered, washed, dried and 
ignited at 1000°C to get alumina.
2Al(OH)3                    Al2O3 + 3H2O
1000°c
(ii) Electrolytic reduction of alumina – 
Hall’s Process
Aluminium is produced by the electrolytic 
reduction of fused alumina (Al2O3) in the 
electrolytic cell.
Cathode: Iron tank lined with graphite
Anode:  A bunch of graphite rods suspended in 
molten electrolyte.
Electrolyte:  Pure alumina+ molten cryolite 
+ fluorspar (fluorspar lowers the 
fusion temperature of electrolyte) 
Temperature: 900 - 950 °C
Voltage used: 5-6 V
Overall reaction: 2 Al2O3 → 4 Al +3 O2↑

 Physical Properties of Aluminium
• 
It is a silvery white metal
• 
It has low density (2.7) and it is light
• 
It is malleable and ductile
• 
It is a good conductor of heat and 
electricity.
• 
Its melting point is 660 °C.
• 
It can be polished to produce a shiny attractive 
appearance.
 Chemical Properties of Aluminium
i. Reaction with air: It is not affected by 
dry air. On heating at 800 °C, aluminium 
burns very brightly forming it’s oxide and 
nitride.
4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3(Aluminium oxide)
2 Al + N2 → 2 AlN (Aluminium nitride)
ii. Reaction with water: Water does not react 
with aluminium due to the layer of oxide 
on it. When steam is passed over red hot 
aluminium, hydrogen is produced.
2 Al + 3 H2O → Al2O3 + 3 H2↑

(Con.)
More to Know
Dilute or concentrated nitric acid does not 
attack aluminium, but it renders aluminium 
passive due to the formation of an oxide film 
on its surface.
v. As reducing agent: Aluminium is a 
powerful reducing agent. When a mixture of 
aluminium powder and iron oxide is ignited, 
the latter is reduced to metal. This process is 
known as aluminothermic process.
Fe2O3 + 2 Al → 2 Fe + Al2O3  + Heat.
Uses 
Aluminium is used in
• 
household utensils
• 
electrical cable industry 
• 
making aeroplanes and other industrial 
mechine parts
 8.8   METALLURGY OF COPPER

The chief ore of copper is copper pyrite. It 
yields nearly 76% of the world production of 
copper. Extraction of copper from copper pyrites 
involves the following steps
i. Concentration of ore: The ore is crushed 
and the concentrated by froth floatation 
process.
ii. Roasting: The concentrated ore is roasted in 
excess of air. During the process of roasting, 
the moisture and volatile impurities are 
removed. Sulphur, phosphorus, arsenic and 
antimony are removed as oxides. Copper 
pyrite is partly converted into sulphides of 
copper and iron.
2 CuFeS2 + O2  
 Cu2S + 2 FeS + SO2 ↑
iii. Smelting: The roasted ore is mixed with 
powdered coke and sand and is heated in a 
blast furnace to obtain matte (Cu2S + FeS) 
and slag. The slag is removed as waste.
iv. Bessemerisation: The molten matte is 
transferred to Bessemer converter in order to 
obtain blister copper. Ferrous sulphide from 
matte is oxidized to ferrous oxide, which is 
removed as slag using silica.

v. Refining: Blister copper contains 98% 
of pure copper and 2% of impurities and 
is purified by electrolytic refining. This 
method is used to get metal of a high degree 
of purity. For electrolytic refining of copper, 
we use:

Periodic Classificaiton of Elements
Cathode: A thin plate of pure copper metal.
Anode: A block of impure copper metal.
Electrolyte:  Copper 
sulphate 
solution 
acidified with sulphuric acid.
When electric current is passed through 
the electrolytic solution, pure copper gets 
deposited at the cathode and the impurities 
settle at the bottom of the anode in the form of 
sludge called anode mud.
Physical Properties of Copper
Copper is a reddish brown metal, with 
high lustre, high density and high melting point 
(1356°C).
Chemical Properties of Copper
i. Action of Air and Moisture: Copper gets 
covered with a green layer of basic copper 
carbonate in the presence of CO2 and 
moisture.
2 Cu + O2 + CO2 + H2O → CuCO3.Cu(OH)2
ii. Action of Heat: On heating at different 
temperatures in the presence of oxygen, 
copper forms two types of oxides CuO and 
Cu2O.
2 Cu + O2 
below 1370K 2 CuO
 
(copper II oxide- black)
4 Cu + O2 
above 1370K 2 Cu2O 
 
(copper I oxide – red)
iii. Action of Acids:
a) With dilute HCl and dilute H2SO4:
 Dilute acids such as HCl and H2SO4 have 
no action on these metals in the absence of 
air. Copper dissolves in these acids in the 
presence of air.
2 Cu + 4 HCl + O2 (air) 
 2 CuCl2 + 2 H2O
b) With dil. HNO3:
 Copper reacts with dil. HNO3 with the 
liberation of Nitric Oxide gas.
3 Cu + 8 HNO3 →  3 Cu(NO3)2 + 2 NO ↑ + 
4H2O
iv) Action of Chlorine:
 Chlorine reacts with copper, resulting in the 
formation of copper(II) chloride.
Cu + Cl2 
 CuCl2
v) Action of Alkalis:

available next to aluminium. It occurs in nature 
as oxides, sulphides and carbonates. The ores of 
iron are as follows:
Ores of iron
Formula
Haematite
Fe2O3
Magnetite
Fe3O4
Iron pyrite
FeS2
Iron is chiefly extracted from haematite ore 
(Fe2O3)
i. Concentration by Gravity Separation: The 
powdered ore is washed with a steam of 
water. As a result, the lighter sand particles 
and other impurities are washed away and 
the heavier ore particles settle down.
ii. Roasting 
and 
Calcination: 
The 
concentrated ore is strongly heated in a 
limited supply of air in a reverberatory 
furnace. As a result, moisture is driven 
out and sulphur, arsenic and phosphorus 
impurities are oxidized off.

Figure 8.11 Blast Furnace
(a)  The Lower Region (Combustion Zone)- 
The temperature is at 1500°C. In this region, 
coke burns with oxygen to form CO2 when 
the charge comes in contact with a hot blast 
of air.
C + O2 
 CO2 + Heat
 It is an exothermic reaction since heat is 
liberated. 
(b)  The Middle Region (Fusion Zone) – The

It is remelted and cast into different 
moulds. This iron is called cast iron.
Physical properties: 
i. 
It is a lustrous metal, greyish white in colour.
ii. It has high tensility, malleability and 
ductility.

and liberates SO2.
 2 Fe + 6 H2SO4 → Fe2(SO4)3 + 3 SO2 + 6 H2O
When iron is dipped in con. HNO3 it 
becomes chemically passive or inert due to the 
formation of a layer of iron oxide (Fe3O4) on its 
surface.
Types and uses of iron
Pig iron (Iron with 2.0% - 4.5% of carbon): 
It is used in making pipes, stoves, radiators, 
railings, manhole covers and drain pipes. 
Steel (Iron with 0.25% - 2.0% of carbon): It is 
used in the construction of buildings, machinery, 
transmission cables and T.V towers and in 
making alloys. 
Wrought iron (Iron with < 0.25% of carbon):

electromagnets. 
 8.10  ALLOYS
An alloy is a homogeneous mixture of two 
or more metals or of one or more metals with 
certain non-metallic elements. 
The properties of alloys are often different 
from those of its components. Pure gold is brittle 
to be used. The addition of small percentage of 
copper enhances its strength and utility.
8.10.1 Amalgam 
An amalgam is an alloy of mercury with 
another metal. These alloys are formed through 
metallic bonding with the electrostatic force 
of attraction between the electrons and the 
positively charged metal ions. Silver tin amalgam 
is used for dental filling.
Reasons for alloying: 
i. 
To modify appearance and colour
ii. To modify chemical activity.
iii. To lower the melting point.
iv. To increase hardness and tensile strength.
v. To increase resistance to electricity.
8.10.2 Method of making alloys 
(a) By fusing the metals together. E.g. Brass 
is made by melting zinc and copper.
(b) By compressing finely divided metals. 
E.g. Wood metal: an alloy of lead, tin, bismuth 
and cadmium powder is a fusible alloy.
Alloys as solid solutions:
Alloys can be considered as solid solutions 
in which the metal with high concentration is 
solvent and other metals are solute.
For example, brass is a solid solution of zinc 
(solute) in copper (solvent).
8.10.3 Types of Alloys
Based on the presence of Iron, alloys can be 
classified into:
• 
Ferrous alloys: Contain Iron as a major 
component. A few examples of ferrous 
alloys are Stainless Steel, Nickel Steel etc.
• 
Non-ferrous alloys: These alloys do 
not contain Iron as a major component. 
For example, Aluminium alloy, Copper 
alloy etc.

Rust is chemically known as hydrated ferric 
oxide (it is formulated as Fe2O3.xH2O). Rusting 
results in the formation of scaling reddish 
brown hydrated ferric oxide on the surface of 
iron and iron containing materials.
8.11.1 Types of Corrosion
i. Dry Corrosion or Chemical Corrosion: 
The corrosive action in the absence of 
moisture is called dry corrosion. It is the 
process of a chemical attack on a metal by 
a corrosive liquids or gases such as O2, N2, 
SO2, H2S etc. It occurs at high temperature. 
Of all the gases mentioned above O2 is the 
most reactive gas to impart the chemical 
attack.
ii. Wet 
Corrosion 
or 
Electrochemical 
Corrosion: The corrosive action in the 
presence of moisture is called wet corrosion. 
It occurs as a result of electrochemical 
reaction of metal with water or aqueous 
solution of salt or acids or bases. 
8.11.2  Methods of preventing 
corrosion
i. Alloying: The metals can be alloyed to 
prevent from the process of corrosion. E.g: 
Stainless Steel
ii. Surface Coating: It involves application of a 
protective coating over the metal. It is of the 
following types:
a) 
Galvanization: It is the process of 
coating zinc on iron sheets by using 
electric current.
b) 
Electroplating: It is a method of coating 
one metal over another metal by passing 
electric current.
c) 
Anodizing: It is an electrochemical 
process that converts the metal surface 
into a decorative, durable and corrosion 
resistant. Aluminium is widely used for 
anodizing process.
d) Cathodic Protection: It is the method of 
controlling corrosion of a metal surface 
protected is coated with the metal which 
is easily corrodible. The easily corrodible 
metal is called Sacrificial metal to act as 
anode ensuring cathodic protection.
 8.12  PAMBAN BRIDGE
It is a railway bridge which connects the 
town of Rameshwaram on Pamban Island to 
mainland India. Opened on 1914, it was India’s 
first sea bridge in India until the opening of the 
BandraWorli Sea Link in 2010. We can control 
the corrosion and renovation of historical 
pamban bridge by a periodical protective 
coating which will be the strong example for 
applied chemistry to uphold our history.
