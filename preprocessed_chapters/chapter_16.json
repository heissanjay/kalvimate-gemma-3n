Auxins are produced at the tip of stems and roots from where they migrate to the zone of elongation. Charles Darwin in 1880 observed unilateral growth and curvature of canary grass (Phalariscanariensis) coleoptiles. He came to the conclusion that some ‘influence’ was transmitted from the tip of the coleoptile to the basal region. This ‘influence’ was later identified as Auxin by Went."

In his next experiment he placed the detached coleoptile tips on agar blocks. After an hour, he discarded the tips and placed this agar block on the decapitated coleoptile. It grew straight up indicating that some chemical had diffused from the cut coleoptile tips into the agar block which stimulated the growth.",
