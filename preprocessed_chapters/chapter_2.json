                "Light is a form of energy which travels in the form of waves. The path of light is called ray of light and group of these rays are called as beam of light. Any object which gives out light are termed as source of light. Some of the sources emit their own light and they are called as luminous objects. All the stars, including the Sun, are examples for luminous objects. We all know that we are able to see objects with the help of our eyes. Butwe cannot see any object in a dark room. Can you explain why? If your answer is ‘we need light to see objects’, the next question is ‘if you make the light from a torch to fall on your eyes, will you be able to see the objects? ’ Definitely, ‘NO’. We can see the objects only when the light is made to fall on the objects and the light reflected from the objects is viewed by our eyes. You would have studied about the reflection and refraction of light elaborately in your previous classes. In this chapter, we shall discuss about the scattering of light, images formed by convex and concave lenses, human eye and optical instruments such as telescopes and microscopes."

On the other hand, a composite source of light produces a white light which contains light of different colours. Sun light is a composite light which consists of light of various colours or wavelengths. Another example for a composite source is a mercury vapour lamp. What do you observe when a white light is refracted through a glass prism?",

                "Cornea: This is the thin and transparent layer on the front surface of the eyeball as shown in figure 2. 15. It is the main refracting surface. When light enters through the cornea, it refracts or bends the light on to the lens.",
                "Iris: It is the coloured part of the eye. It may be blue, brown or green in colour. Every person has a unique colour, pattern and texture. Iris controls amount of light entering into the pupil like camera aperture.",
                "Pupil: It is the centre part of the Iris. It is the pathway for the light to retina.",

                "Working of the eye",
                "The transparent layer cornea bends the light rays through pupil located at the centre part of the Iris. The adjusted light passes through the eye lens. Eye lens is convex in nature. So, the light rays from the objects are converged and a real and inverted image is formed on retina. Then, retina passes the received real and inverted image to the brain through optical nerves. Finally, the brain senses it as erects image.",
                "^of Accommodation",
                "The ability of the eye lens to focus nearby as well as the distant objects is called ^of accommodation of the eye. This is achieved by changing the focal length of the eye lens with the help of ciliary muscles. Eye lens is made of a flexible, jelly - like material. By relaxing and contracting the ciliary muscle, the curvature and hence the call length of the eye lens can be altered. When we see distant objects, the ciliary muscle relaxes and makes the eye lens thinner. This increases the focal length of the eye lens. Hence, the distant object can be clearly seen. On the other hand, when we look at a closer object, the focal length of the eye lens is decreased by the contraction of ciliary muscle. Thus, the image of the closer object is clearly formed on the retina.",

This could happen due to many reasons including ageing. Hence, their vision becomes defective. Let us discuss some of the common defects of human eye.",
                "Myopia, also known as short sightedness, occurs due to the lengthening of eye ball. With this defect, nearby objects can be seen clearly but distant objects cannot be seen clearly. The focal length of eye lens is reduced or the distance between eye lens and retina increases. Hence, the far point will not be infinity for such eyes and the far point has come closer. Due to this, the image of distant objects is formed before the retina (Figure 2. 16 - a). This defect can be corrected using a concave lens (Figure 2. 16 - b). The focal length of the concave lens to be used is computed as follows:",

                "Hypermetropia",
                "Hypermetropia, also known as long sightedness, occurs due to the shortening of eye ball. With this defect, distant objects can be seen clearly but nearby objects cannot be seen clearly. The focal length of eye lens is increased or the distance between eye lens and retina decreases. Hence, the near point will not be at 25cm for such eyes and the near point has moved farther. Due to this, the image of nearby objects is formed behind the retina (Figure 2. 17 - a). This defect can be corrected using a convex lens (Figure 2. 17 - b). The focal length of the convex lens to be used is computed as follows:",

                "Some persons may have both the defects of vision - myopia as well as hypermetropia. This can be corrected by ‘bifocal lenses’ in which, upper part consists of concave lens (to correct myopia) used for distant vision and the lower part consists of convex lens (to correct hypermetropia) used for reading purposes.",

                "In this defect, eye cannot see parallel and horizontal lines clearly. It may be inherited or acquired. It is due to the imperfect structure of eye lens because of the development of cataract on the lens, ulceration of cornea, injury to the refracting surfaces, etc. . Astigmatism can be corrected by using cylindrical lenses."
