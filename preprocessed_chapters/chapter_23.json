The individual book can be considered as a ‘file’ and the whole set of books in a shelf can be considered as folders. When we right click on the mouse, the popup menu appears on the screen with multiple options. Select ‘NEW’ option and a secondary menu comes up with another set of options. Select ‘Folder’ option in the menu. You can now save your file or files in the newly created folder.",

For example photos, audio - visuals, drawings, animations all these can be created easily with the help of computer. Cinema is a good example for ‘Visual Communication Device’."
