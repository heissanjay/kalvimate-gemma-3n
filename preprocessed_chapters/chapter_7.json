                "The first scientific theory of the atom was proposed by John Dalton. Few of the postulates of Dalton’s theory about an atom were found incorrect by the later on studies made by J. J. Thomson, Rutherford, Neils Bohr and Schrodinger. In the light of the result of the research most of the limitations of the Dalton’s theory wereremoved and a new theory known as the modern atomic theory was put forward. ‘The main postulates of modern atomic theory’ are as follows:",

                "As you know, anything that has mass and occupies space is called matter. Atoms are the building blocks of matter. Since matter has mass, it must be due to its atoms. According to the modern atomic theory, an atom contains subatomic particles such as protons, neutrons and electrons. Protons and neutrons have considerable mass, but electrons don't have such a considerable mass. Thus, the mass of an atom is mainly contributed by its protons and neutrons and hence the sum of the number of protons and neutrons of an atom is called its mass number.",

                "As an atom is very small, its absolute mass cannot be determined directly. The early pioneers of chemistry used to measure the atomic mass of an atom relative to an atom of another element. They measured the masses of equal number of atoms of two or more elements at a time, to determine their relative masses. They established one element as a standard, gave it an arbitrary value of atomic mass and using this value they measured the relative mass of other elements. The mass obtained by this way is called relative atomic mass. In the beginning, the mass of hydrogen atom was chosen as a standard and masses of other atoms were compared with it, because of the existence of isotopic character of hydrogen (1H1, 1H2, 1H3). Later hydrogen atom was replaced by oxygen atom as the standard. Now, the stable isotope of carbon (C - 12) with atomic mass 12 is used as the standard for measuring the relative atomic mass of an element.",

                "Relative Atomic Mass",
                "Modern methods of determination of atomic mass by Mass Spectrometry uses C - 12 as standard. For most of the elements, the relative atomic mass is very closer to a whole number, and it is rounded off to a whole number, to make calculations easier. Table 7. 1 lists some of the elements of periodic table and their Relative Atomic mass values.",

It is observed, from the periodic table that atomic masses of most of the elements are not whole numbers. For instance, the atomic mass of carbon given in the periodic table is 12. 01 amu, not 12. 00 amu. The reason is that while calculating the atomic mass of carbon, both of its natural isotopes such as carbon - 12. and carbon - 13 are considered.
