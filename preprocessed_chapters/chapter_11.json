                "You have studied, in your lower classes, that carbon is an inseparable element in human life as we use innumerable number of carbon compounds in our day - to - day life. Because, the food we eat, medicines we take when ill, clothes we wear; domestic and automobile fuels, paint, cosmetics, automobile parts, etc. , that we use contain carbon compounds. The number of carbon compounds found in nature and man - made, is much higher than that of any other element in the periodic table. In fact there are more than 5 million compounds of carbon. The unique nature of carbon, such as catenation, tetravalency and multiple bonding, enables it to combine with itself or other elements like hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur etc. , and hence form large number of compounds. All these compounds are made of covalent bonds. These compounds are called organic compounds. In this lesson, you will learn about carbon compounds."

There are millions of organic compounds known and many new organic compounds are discovered every year in nature or synthesized in laboratory. This may mystify organic chemistry to a large extent. However, a unique molecular structure can be assigned to each compound and it can be listed by using systematic methods of classification and eventually named on the basis of its structural arrangements. In early days, chemists recognised that compounds having similar structural features have identical chemical properties. So they began to classify compounds based on the common structural arrangements found among them.",

If the chain contains carbon and other atoms like oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, etc. , these compounds are called heterocyclic compounds. Carbocyclic compounds are further subdivided into alicyclic and aromatic compounds.
