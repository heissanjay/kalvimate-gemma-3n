                "Spontaneous generation (Abiogenesis): According to this theory life originated spontaneously from lifeless matter. It was believed that fishes originated from mud, frogs from moist soil and insects from decaying matter.",

He showed that pre - sterilised flasks kept closed airtight, with killed yeast, did not give rise to any life form, while in another flask kept open to air living organisms arose from killed yeast.",
                "Extra - terrestrial or Cosmic origin: Some scientists still believe that life came from outer space. This states that units of life called spores (Panspermia) were transferred to different planets including earth. This is still an idea of some astronomers. Chemical Evolution of Life: This idea was developed by Oparin (in1922) and Haldane(in1929). They proposed that with the condition prevailing on earth, life arose by a series of sequential chemical reactions. The first form of life could have come from pre - existing non - living inorganic molecules which gave rise to formation of diverse organic molecules which are transformed into colloid system to produce life. The modern concept on chemical evolution regarding origin of life was accepted."

Due to shortage of grass, they were forced to feed on leaves from trees.

At that time the British Admiralty planned a voyage of exploration for 5 years on a ship named H. M. S. Beagle around South America. Dr Henslow was asked to nominate a young naturalist for the voyage. Darwin was given the opportunity. During his five years (1831–1835) voyage he visited many parts of the world, a number of islands including the Galapagos Island and Pacific Island. Darwin made elaborate observations on nature of the land, plants and animals of the regions he visited. He further worked for a period of 20 years to develop the theory of natural selection.",
