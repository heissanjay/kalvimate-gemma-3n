                "You have learnt about mixtures in your lower classes. Most of the substances that we encounter in our daily life are mixtures of two or more substances. The substances present in a mixture may exist in one or more physical state. For example, when we burn wood, the smoke released is a mixture of solid carbon and gases like C O2, C O, etc.",
                "In some cases of mixtures, their components can be separated easily whereas in some other cases they cannot be. Consider the two mixtures, one which contains salt and water, and the another which contains sand and water. Water is the one of the components in both the mixtures. In the first case salt dissolves in water. In the second case the sand does not dissolve in water. Sand in water can be separated by filtration but salt cannot be separated as it dissolves in water to form a homogeneous mixture. This kind of homogenous mixtures are termed as “Solutions”.",

                "All the life forms on the earth are associated with Solutions. Plants take Solutions of nutrients for their growth from the soil. Most of the liquids found in human body including blood, lymph and urine are Solutions. Day to day human activities like washing, cooking, cleaning and few other activities involve the formation of Solutions with water. Similarly, the drinks what we take, like fruit juice, aerated drinks, tea, coffee etc. are also Solutions. Therefore, the ability of water to form Solutions is responsible for sustenance of life"

                "We know that, a Solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. In a Solution, the component which is present in lesser amount (by weight), is called solute and the component, which is present in a larger amount (by weight) is called solvent. The solute gets distributed uniformly throughout the solvent and thus forming the mixture homogeneous. So, the solvent acts as a dissolving medium in a Solution. The process of uniform distribution of solute into solvent is called disSolution. Figure 9. 2 shows the schematic representation of Solution.",
                "A Solution must at least be consisting of two components (a solute and a solvent). Such Solutions which are made of one solute and one solvent (two components) are called binary Solutions. e. g. On adding copper sulphate crystals to water, it dissolves in water forming a Solution of copper sulphate as shown in Figure 9. 3. It contains two components i. e. one solute - copper sulphate and one solvent - water So it is a binary Solution. Similarly, a Solution may contain more than two components. For example if salt and sugar are added to water, both dissolve in water forming a Solution. Here two solutes are dissolved in one solvent. Such kind of Solutions which contain three components are called ternary Solutions.",

When you taste them, you feel that one is sweeter than the other. What do you infer from it? The tea which sweet more contains higher amount of sugar than the other. How can you express your observation? You can say that the tea is stronger. But a chemist would say that it is ‘concentrated’.

The extent of disSolution of a solute in a solvent can be better explained by its solubility. Solubility is a measure of how much of a solute can be dissolved in a specified amount of a solvent.",

Although water dissolves an enormous variety of substances, both ionic and covalent, it does not dissolve everything. The phrase that scientists often use when predicting solubility is “like dissolves like. ” This expression means that dissolving occurs when similarities exist between the solvent and the solute. For example: Common salt is a polar compound and dissolves readily in polar solvent like water. Non - polar compounds are soluble in non - polar solvents. For example, Fat dissolved in ether. But non - polar compounds, do not dissolve in polar solvents; polar compounds do not dissolve in non - polar solvents.",

For example, a greater amount of sugar will dissolve in warm water than in cold water. In endothermic process, solubility increases with increase in temperature. In exothermic process, solubility decreases with increase in temperature.",
                "Solubility of Gases in liquid Do you know why is it bubbling when water is boiled? Solubility of gases in liquid decrease with increase in temperature. Generally, water contains dissolved oxygen. When water is boiled, the solubility of oxygen in water decreases, so oxygen escapes in the form of bubbles. Aquatic animals live more in cold regions because, more amount of dissolved oxygen is present in the water of cold regions. This shows that the solubility of oxygen in water is more at low temperatures.",
