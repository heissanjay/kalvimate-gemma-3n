                "Mendel (1822 - 1884) was an Austrian monk who discovered the basic principles of heredity through his experiments. His experiments are the foundation for modern genetics. He was born in 1822 to a family of farmers in Silesian of Czechoslovakia. After finishing his high school at the age of 18, he entered the Augustinian Monastery at Brunn as a priest. From there he went to the University of Vienna for training in physics, mathematics and natural science. Mendel returned to the monastery in 1854 and continued to work as a priest and teach in high school. In his leisure time he started his famous experiments on the garden pea plant. He conducted his experiments in the monastery for about seven years from 1856 to 1863. He had worked on nearly 10000 pea plants of 34 different varieties. Mendel noted that they differ from one another in many ways.",

Tallness and Dwarfness are determined by a pair of contrasting factors, tall plant possess a pair of factors (represented by capital T - taking the first letter of the dominant character) and a plant is dwarf because it possesses factors for dwarfness (represented as small t - recessive character). These factors occur",

                "The factors are always pure and when gametes are formed, the unit factors segregate so that each gamete gets one of the two alternative factors. It means that factors for tallness(capital T) and dwarfness(small t) are separate entities and in a gamete either capital T or small t is present. When F1 hybrids are self crossed the two entities separate and then unite independently, forming tall and dwarf plants.",

                "The term mutation was introduced by Hugo De Vries in 1901 when he observed phenotypic changes in the evening primrose plant, Oenothera jamarckiana. Mutation is an inheritable sudden change in the genetic material (DNA) of an organism. Mutations are classified into two main types, namely chromosomal mutation and gene mutation.",

                "Euploidy: It is the condition in which the individual bears more than the usual number of diploid (2n) chromosomes. If an individual has three haploid sets of chromosomes, the condition is called triploidy (3n). Triploid plants and animals are typically sterile. If it has four haploid sets of chromosomes, the condition is called tetraploidy (4n). Tetraploid plants are advantageous as they often result in increased fruit and flower size.",

                "Sickle cell anaemia is caused by the mutation of a single gene. Alteration in the gene brings a change in the structure of the protein part of haemoglobin molecule. Due to the change in the protein molecule, the red blood cell (RBC) that carries the haemoglobin is sickle shaped.",
